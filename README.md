# NVIDIA Cloud Functions

NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) is a platform for deploying, managing, and running GPU-accelerated workloads at scale. It routes inference, streaming, and other GPU work to worker clusters, so you can scale demanding workloads with less infrastructure to run yourself.

This monorepo contains NVCF service code, deployment assets, documentation,
examples, CLI code, agent skills, and validation tooling.

## Architecture

![NVCF architecture](docs/user/images/nvcf-high-level-stack.svg)

NVCF runs as Kubernetes services that manage function lifecycle, invocation
routing, GPU cluster integration, artifact access, secrets, observability, and
operations.

At a high level:

- The control plane exposes the NVCF API, manages function and deployment
  state, handles secret management, and coordinates platform operations.
- The invocation plane receives HTTP, streaming, and gRPC requests, applies
  routing and rate limiting, and sends work to running function workloads.
- GPU clusters connect through the NVIDIA Cluster Agent (NVCA). NVCA registers
  GPU resources and manages workload execution on GPU nodes.
- Function artifacts live in registries that the NVCF deployment can access.
- Observability, dashboards, and runbooks help operators monitor health and
  debug workload behavior.

The following diagram shows how self-managed NVCF can span regions and GPU
clusters.

### Workload types

NVCF functions are long-running, invokable workloads. Use a function when a
client needs an endpoint for inference, streaming, or another service-style GPU
workflow. Functions can be packaged as a container when the workload is a single
service with health and inference endpoints, or as a Helm chart when the
workload needs multiple coordinated containers, services, sidecars, or other
Kubernetes resources.

NVCF tasks are asynchronous, run-to-completion workloads. Use a task for batch
inference, evaluation, fine-tuning, data preparation, or other GPU jobs that
should finish and report status instead of staying online behind an invocation
endpoint. Tasks can be packaged as a container when the workload is a single
service with health and inference endpoints, or as a Helm chart when the
workload needs multiple coordinated containers, services, sidecars, or other
Kubernetes resources.

### Core capabilities

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Unified control plane | Manages and routes requests across multi-region GPU clusters. |
| Load-balanced workload routing | Balances inference, streaming, and custom workloads based on worker availability. |
| Multiple protocols | Supports multiple protocols for different workload and client needs. |
| Multi-cluster autoscaling | Scales workloads from zero to max across clusters. |
| Mixed GPU support | Supports mixed GPU types across clusters for workloads with different GPU requirements. |
| Health checks and telemetry | Tracks worker status and request latency through health checks and telemetry. |

## Building with Bazel

Bazel is the build, test, and packaging tool across the monorepo. Native
subtrees (`src/clis/nvcf-cli`, `src/libraries/go/lib`) build fully under
Bazel today. Phase B has additionally landed Bazel scaffolds in
synthetic-import upstreams: `nvcf-grpc-proxy`, `nvcf-ratelimiter`,
`nvcf-nats-auth-callout-service`, `nvcf-cache/nvcf-unbound` (dns-cache),
`nvcf-image-credential-helper`, and `nvca`. Their `BUILD.bazel`,
`MODULE.bazel`, and `rules/oci/` files are picked up automatically when
the subtrees are synced into the umbrella; from the umbrella you can
build, test, and produce OCI images for any of them without leaving the
monorepo.

Quick start (Linux):

```bash
curl -fSL -o ~/.local/bin/bazel \
  "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.25.0/bazelisk-linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture)"
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/bazel

# Native subtrees
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli            # host binary
bazel test  //src/clis/nvcf-cli/...                 # unit tests
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:dist                # all 5 platforms

# Phase B upstream example: build the grpc-proxy multi-arch OCI image
bazel build //src/invocation-plane-services/grpc-proxy:image_index
bazel test  //src/invocation-plane-services/grpc-proxy/...

# Run the full tree
bazel test //...
```

Quick start (macOS):

```bash
brew install bazelisk

bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli
bazel test  //src/clis/nvcf-cli/...
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:dist
```

Builds read from the team Buildbarn cache at `nvcfbarn.nvidia.com` by default
and do not upload local results. To seed the cache from a dev box (corp
network or VPN required), add `--config=remote-write`:

```bash
bazel build --config=remote-write //src/clis/nvcf-cli/...
```

Full setup, day-to-day commands, OCI image build/push, stamping, caches,
remote-cache probe, and CI map live in [`BAZEL.md`](BAZEL.md). For the
end-to-end monorepo overview (how upstream services flow into the
umbrella, how the OSS mirror is produced, how the cache is provisioned),
see [`nvidia-internal/nvcf-monorepo-guide/`](nvidia-internal/nvcf-monorepo-guide/README.md).
For CLI-specific developer flow see [`src/clis/nvcf-cli/README.md`](src/clis/nvcf-cli/README.md).

## Support

- File bugs, feature ideas, and documentation requests as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nvidia/nvcf/issues/new/choose). Use the appropriate template and include the component name in the title (for example, [nvcf-nvca] Pod fails to start on arm64).
- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcf/discussions) for support and usage help.
- To report a security vulnerability see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Do not open a public issue.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes, from typo fixes to new features. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

NVCF is a new open source project, and we are actively smoothing the
contribution workflow. We accept external contributions through GitHub pull
requests today, with a few temporary wrinkles while the repository becomes more
GitHub-native.

Before changing a service, read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the nearest nested
`AGENTS.md`. The nested file is the best source for service-specific build,
test, style, and review expectations.

Use Conventional Commits.
For documentation-only changes, run `git diff --check` and any targeted
validation that applies to the changed files.
