> [!NOTE]
> The NVCF CLI is now maintained natively in this monorepo under [`src/clis/nvcf-cli`](src/clis/nvcf-cli/). The former `ncp/nvcf/cli` repository is retained as historical import context; new CLI changes should land here.

# NVIDIA Cloud Functions

NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) is a platform for deploying, managing, and running GPU-accelerated workloads at scale. It routes inference, streaming, and other GPU work to worker clusters, so you can scale demanding workloads with less infrastructure to run yourself.

This monorepo contains NVCF service code, deployment assets, documentation,
examples, CLI code, agent skills, and validation tooling.

## Architecture

![NVCF architecture](docs/user/images/self-hosted-component-overview.png)

NVCF runs as Kubernetes services that manage function lifecycle, invocation
routing, GPU cluster integration, artifact access, secrets, observability, and
operations.

At a high level:

- The control plane exposes the NVCF API, manages function and deployment
  state, handles secret management, and coordinates platform operations.
- The invocation plane receives HTTP, streaming, and gRPC requests, applies
  routing and rate limiting, and sends work to running function workloads.
- GPU clusters connect through the NVIDIA Cluster Agent (NVCA). NVCA registers
  GPU resources and manages workload execution on GPU nodes.
- Function artifacts live in registries that the NVCF deployment can access.
- Observability, dashboards, and runbooks help operators monitor health and
  debug workload behavior.

### Workload types

NVCF functions are long-running, invokable workloads. Use a function when a
client needs an endpoint for inference, streaming, or another service-style GPU
workflow. Functions can be packaged as a container when the workload is a single
service with health and inference endpoints, or as a Helm chart when the
workload needs multiple coordinated containers, services, sidecars, or other
Kubernetes resources.

NVCF tasks are asynchronous, run-to-completion workloads. Use a task for batch
inference, evaluation, fine-tuning, data preparation, or other GPU jobs that
should finish and report status instead of staying online behind an invocation
endpoint. Tasks can be packaged as a container when the workload is a single
service with health and inference endpoints, or as a Helm chart when the
workload needs multiple coordinated containers, services, sidecars, or other
Kubernetes resources.

### Core capabilities

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Unified control plane | Manages and routes requests across multi-region GPU clusters. |
| Load-balanced workload routing | Balances inference, streaming, and custom workloads based on worker availability. |
| Multiple protocols | Supports multiple protocols for different workload and client needs. |
| Multi-cluster autoscaling | Scales workloads from zero to max across clusters. |
| Mixed GPU support | Supports mixed GPU types across clusters for workloads with different GPU requirements. |
| Health checks and telemetry | Tracks worker status and request latency through health checks and telemetry. |

## Support

- If you have found a bug or want to request a feature, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nvidia/nvcf/issues/new/choose) in this repository. Use the appropriate template and include the component name in the title (e.g., [nvcf-nvca] Pod fails to start on arm64).
- To report a security vulnerability see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Do not open a public issue.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes, from typo fixes to new features. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

Before changing a service, read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the nearest nested
`AGENTS.md`. The nested file is the best source for service-specific build,
test, style, and review expectations.

Use Conventional Commits. Include a JIRA or NVBug reference when one exists.
For documentation-only changes, run `git diff --check` and any targeted
validation that applies to the changed files.
