# Agent Skills Repository Guidelines

This subtree contains public Agent Skills for NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF). All skills must comply with the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) with NVCARPS-specific extensions. This repository is compatible with the [Vercel Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

## Instructions

Use this file as the authoring contract for every public skill in `user/skills/` and `dev/skills/`. Keep private skills under `nvidia-internal/`.

When adding or editing a skill, keep the external skill spec fields at the top level of the frontmatter, retain the required NVCARPS fields under `metadata`, and include a concise `## Instructions` section in the body.

## Skill Structure

Source skills live under `user/skills/` or `dev/skills/`. Each skill must be in its own subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` file. The directory name must match the `name` field in the frontmatter.

```
user/skills/
- user-skill-name/
  - SKILL.md

dev/skills/
- dev-skill-name/
  - SKILL.md
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | 1-64 chars, lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, must match directory name |
| `description` | string | 1-1024 chars, must describe what AND when to use, include keywords for discoverability |
| `author` | string | Author name or team |
| `version` | string | Semantic version string |
| `tags` | array | Categorization tags (recommend 1-5 items for top-level spec compatibility) |
| `tools` | array | Agent tools required by the skill (for example `Shell`, `Read`, `Write`) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `license` | string | License name or reference to bundled license file |
| `compatibility` | string | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements |
| `metadata` | object | NVCARPS metadata fields (see below) |

### NVCARPS Metadata Fields (Required)

These fields must be placed inside the `metadata` object:

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `internal` | boolean | Must be `false` for public skills in this subtree | `false` |
| `author` | string | Author name and NVIDIA email | `"Your Name <your-email@nvidia.com>"` |
| `version` | string | Skill version | `"1.0"` |
| `tags` | array | List of searchable tags | `["ngc", "nvcf", "cli"]` |
| `languages` | array | Programming languages this skill applies to | `["bash", "python"]` |
| `frameworks` | array | Frameworks or libraries this skill covers | `["ngc-cli"]` |
| `domain` | string | Domain or area of expertise | `"cloud-infrastructure"` |

### Fields NOT to Include

- `alwaysApply` - This is for rules, not skills
- `globs` - This is for rules, not skills

Skills are invoked on-demand, not automatically applied like rules.

## Name Validation Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (`a-z`, `0-9`, `-`)
- Must not start or end with a hyphen
- Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match the parent directory name exactly

## Description Best Practices

Include:
1. What the skill does (actions it enables)
2. When to use it (trigger phrases, keywords)

Example:
```yaml
description: Manage NVCF clusters via NGC CLI. Register, list, and delete clusters for function and task deployments. Use when registering clusters, managing cluster configurations, or when the user mentions ngc cf cluster, NVCF clusters, or cluster registration.
```

## Body Content Guidelines

- Keep main `SKILL.md` under 500 lines
- Move detailed reference material to `references/` directory
- Include a concise `## Instructions` section near the top of the body
- Include step-by-step instructions
- Provide command examples
- Document common edge cases

### Standard Sections for CLI Skills

1. Before You Start - list required config, binaries, and access.
2. Core Commands - primary operations with examples.
3. Examples - real-world usage scenarios.
4. Additional Resources - links to detailed docs or reference files.

### File References

Use relative paths from the skill root:

```markdown
For detailed examples, see [examples.md](examples.md).
For reference material, see [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md).
Run the helper script: `python scripts/helper.py`
```
