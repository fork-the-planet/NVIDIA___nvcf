# NVCF Gateway Routes Helm Chart

This repository contains the Helm chart for deploying NVCF ingress routes via the Kubernetes Gateway API.

## Overview

The chart deploys `HTTPRoute`, `TCPRoute`, and `ReferenceGrant` resources that attach to an existing Gateway provisioned separately by the cluster operator (e.g. Envoy Gateway, Istio, Traefik, Kong). It also includes optional `PodMonitor` resources for scraping Envoy Gateway proxy metrics with Prometheus.

The chart deploys routing configuration only. It does not include any container images. Backend services referenced by the routes (`api`, `nvct-api`, `api-keys`, `invocation`, `llm-api-gateway`, `vanity-gateway`, `reval`, `sis`, `grpc`, `nats`) must already be deployed separately.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- Helm 3.x
- `kubectl`
- A Gateway API compatible controller installed in the cluster
- An existing `Gateway` resource with an HTTP listener (and TCP listeners if the gRPC or NATS routes are enabled)
- The backend services that the routes target, deployed in their respective namespaces

## Getting Started

Install the chart with the default values plus your own overrides:

```bash
helm install nvcf-gateway-routes chart \
  --namespace gateway \
  --values chart/values.yaml \
  --values path/to/values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m
```

Upgrade an existing release:

```bash
helm upgrade nvcf-gateway-routes chart \
  --namespace gateway \
  --values chart/values.yaml \
  --values path/to/values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m
```

Uninstall the release:

```bash
helm uninstall nvcf-gateway-routes --namespace gateway
```

## Configuration

The default chart configuration lives in `chart/values.yaml`.

Important settings to review before deployment:

- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.domain` for the base hostname used when templating route hostnames
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.gateways.shared.*` for the HTTP Gateway name, namespace, and listener
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.gateways.grpc.*` for the TCP Gateway name, namespace, and listener
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.gateways.nats.*` for the NATS TCP Gateway name, namespace, and listener
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.routes.<route>.enabled` to toggle individual routes
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.routes.nvcfApi.grpc.enabled` and
  `nvcfGatewayRoutes.routes.nvctApi.grpc.enabled` to expose API gRPC routes
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.routes.<http-route>.hostnames` to override the templated HTTP route hostnames
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.routes.<route>.backend.{name,namespace,port}` to point a route at the correct backend service
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.routes.<route>.routeAnnotations` to add annotations consumed by external controllers (e.g. external-dns, cert-manager)
- `nvcfGatewayRoutes.podMonitors.enabled` to opt in to Envoy Gateway proxy `PodMonitor` resources

The default values use `localhost` as the domain and assume backend services are named consistently with NVCF defaults. Override these for any shared or production environment.

Enabled `HTTPRoute` entries must not share a resolved hostname because each `HTTPRoute` in this chart uses a root `PathPrefix /` match on the shared Gateway. Helm rendering fails if two enabled HTTPRoutes would claim the same hostname.

## Routes

| Route | Kind | Default hostname | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nvcfApi` | HTTPRoute | `api.<domain>` | `api.nvcf:8080` |
| `nvcfApi.grpc` | GRPCRoute (disabled by default) | `api.<domain>` | `api.nvcf:9090` |
| `nvctApi` | HTTPRoute | `tasks.<domain>` | `nvct-api.nvcf:8080` |
| `nvctApi.grpc` | GRPCRoute (disabled by default) | `tasks.<domain>` | `nvct-api.nvcf:9090` |
| `apiKeys` | HTTPRoute | `api-keys.<domain>` | `api-keys.api-keys:8080` |
| `invocation` | HTTPRoute | `*.invocation.<domain>` and `invocation.<domain>` | `invocation.nvcf:8080` |
| `llmApiGateway` | HTTPRoute | `llm.<domain>` | `llm-api-gateway.nvcf:8080` |
| `llmInvocation` | HTTPRoute (disabled by default) | `llm.invocation.<domain>` | `llm-api-gateway.nvcf:8080` |
| `vanityGateway` | HTTPRoute (disabled by default) | `vanity.<domain>` | `vanity-gateway.nvcf:8080` |
| `reval` | HTTPRoute | `reval.<domain>` | `reval.nvcf:8080` |
| `sis` | HTTPRoute | `sis.<domain>` | `api.sis:8080` |
| `grpc` | TCPRoute | Not rendered | `grpc.nvcf:10081` |
| `grpcWorker` | TCPRoute (disabled by default) | Not rendered | `grpc.nvcf:10086` |
| `nats` | TCPRoute (disabled by default) | Not rendered | `nats.nats-system:4222` |

Cross-namespace routing is supported via `ReferenceGrant` resources rendered into each backend namespace.

## Notes

- The chart assumes the Gateway is reachable at the resolved hostnames. DNS records and TLS termination are out of scope and must be configured in the surrounding infrastructure.
- The `nats` TCPRoute is plain TCP and does not render hostnames. Configure DNS or TCP load balancer routing outside this chart.
- The `grpc` TCPRoute does not enforce HTTP hostname matching at the Gateway layer. Configure DNS or TCP load balancer routing outside this chart.
- The `grpcWorker` TCPRoute is beta support for split or multi-cluster gRPC worker callbacks. It carries HTTP/1 CONNECT callback traffic only. Enable it only when the control-plane grpc-proxy runs one replica with HPA disabled. Multi-replica grpc-proxy requires pod-specific callback routing and is not supported by this shared TCPRoute.
- Enabling the `nats` route requires a reachable TCP listener for NATS on the referenced Gateway. The HTTP Gateway address does not imply NATS reachability unless that same Gateway also has the NATS TCP listener configured.
