# Deployment

Self-hosted NVCF installation includes the core components required for NVCF inference. Additional optional components such as caching and low latency streaming support are also available.

For a full list of required artifacts, see [self-hosted-artifact-manifest](./manifest.md).

<Tip>
Want to try NVCF locally first? See [local-development](./local-development.md) for a guide to running
the full stack on your laptop using k3d.

## Overview

Installation steps are as follows:

1. **Mirror NVCF artifacts to your registry** — Choose your mirroring approach based on your deployment method:

   - **Terraform with EKS/ECR (Recommended):** Use [Automated ECR Mirroring](./image-mirroring.md) by setting `create_sm_ecr_repos = true` in your Terraform configuration. This handles all image and Helm chart mirroring automatically.
   - **All other deployments:** Follow the [manual mirroring instructions](./image-mirroring.md) to pull artifacts from NGC and push to your registry.

2. **Create a Kubernetes cluster** (Optional, can bring any existing Kubernetes cluster or create an EKS cluster from example Terraform, see [terraform-installation](./terraform-installation.md))

3. **Install NVCF Self-hosted Control Plane** (Required) — Choose your installation method:

   - [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md) *(recommended)* — automated deployment using `helmfile`. **Use Helmfile < 1.2.0** (see [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md) prerequisites for details).
   - [self-hosted-standalone-deployment](./standalone-deployment.md) — individual `helm install` commands, for fine-grained control or GitOps pipelines.

4. **Install Low Latency Streaming** (Optional, for streaming workloads, see [self-hosted-lls-installation](./lls-installation.md))

5. **Install Optional GPU Cluster Enhancements** (Optional, such as caching components, see [self-hosted-optional-enhancements](./optional-enhancements.md))

6. **Configure the NVIDIA Cluster Agent** (Optional, for GPU clusters that run functions; see [self-managed-clusters](./cluster-management/self-managed.md))

## Kubernetes Cluster Requirements

### Cluster Version

- Supported versions are the latest Kubernetes minor release and the two prior minor releases (N-2). See official Kubernetes docs for current supported [versions](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions). 
- Support for dynamic persistent volume provisioning

### Required Operators and Components

**NVIDIA GPU Operator**

Required for GPU workload scheduling. The GPU Operator automates the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPUs in Kubernetes, including:

- NVIDIA device drivers
- Kubernetes device plugin for GPU discovery
- GPU feature discovery for node labeling
- Container runtime integration (containerd, CRI-O, or Docker)
- Monitoring and telemetry tools

See [NVIDIA GPU Operator documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/) for installation instructions.

<Note>
**Fake GPU Operator for Development/Testing:**

For environments without actual GPU hardware, install the fake GPU operator to simulate
GPU resources. See [fake-gpu-operator](./fake-gpu-operator.md) for full instructions.
</Note>

**Network Policies**

Your cluster must support Kubernetes Network Policies if network isolation is required.

**Persistent Storage**

A StorageClass must be configured for persistent volumes. Common options:

- Amazon EKS: `gp3` (default)
- Local development: `local-path`
- Other platforms: Any CSI-compatible storage class

<Note>
Some cloud providers have minimum PVC size requirements. For example, AWS EBS gp3 volumes have a 1Gi minimum.

</Note>

### Cluster Sizing and Storage

See [infrastructure-sizing](./infrastructure-sizing.md) for node pool specifications, storage
recommendations, and three recommended sizing tiers (Development, Minimal HA,
and Production).
