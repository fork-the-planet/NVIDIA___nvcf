# Self-hosted CLI

This page provides documentation for the NVCF Self-hosted CLI, a command-line interface for managing NVIDIA Cloud Functions in self-hosted deployments.

## Overview

The NVCF Self-hosted CLI provides:

- Automatic Token Generation: Generate `NVCF_TOKEN` and API keys via direct API calls
- Smart State Management: Persistent workflow context eliminates manual ID copying
- Multi-Environment Support: Separate configurations for dev/staging/production
- gRPC Invocation: Native support for gRPC function invocation
- Shell Completion: Autocompletion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell

## Prerequisites

- Network access to NVCF API endpoints
- A source checkout with Bazel/Bazelisk when you build from the repository
- [NGC CLI installed](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli) when you download the CLI release from NGC

## Installation

You can build `nvcf-cli` from this repository or download a packaged CLI release
from NGC. Use the source build when you are validating local changes or running
the local k3d quickstart from a repository checkout.

### Build from the repository

Run the build from the repository root:

```bash
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli
```

The binary is written to:

```text
bazel-bin/src/clis/nvcf-cli/nvcf-cli_/nvcf-cli
```

Install it on your `PATH`:

```bash
install -m 0755 \
  bazel-bin/src/clis/nvcf-cli/nvcf-cli_/nvcf-cli \
  /usr/local/bin/nvcf-cli
```

If your environment cannot reach the configured Bazel remote cache, disable the
remote cache for this build:

```bash
bazel build --remote_cache= //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli
```

### Download from NGC

The CLI is available as a resource from NGC. See
[download-nvcf-cli](./image-mirroring.md) for detailed download and extraction
instructions.

The downloaded package includes:

- `nvcf-cli` - The CLI binary
- `.nvcf-cli.yaml.template` - Configuration template
- `examples/` - Sample configuration files
- `USAGE-GUIDE.md` - Detailed usage documentation

## Configuration

The CLI uses YAML configuration files. If you downloaded the packaged CLI, copy
the included template:

```bash
cp .nvcf-cli.yaml.template .nvcf-cli.yaml
```

If you built the CLI from source, create `.nvcf-cli.yaml` from the examples
below or from `src/clis/nvcf-cli/examples/config-dev.yaml`.

Configuration files are searched in this order:

1. Explicit path via `--config` flag (highest priority)
2. Current directory: `./.nvcf-cli.yaml`
3. Home directory: `~/.nvcf-cli.yaml`

<Tip>
Place your `.nvcf-cli.yaml` in the directory where you run the CLI for project-specific configuration, or in your home directory for global configuration.

</Tip>

### Self-Hosted Configuration

For self-hosted deployments, the CLI must be configured to communicate with
your gateway. The gateway uses hostname-based routing for HTTP services.

<Note>
For Gateway routing details, including architecture diagrams, verification commands, and production DNS/HTTPS setup, see [gateway-routing](./gateway-routing.md).

</Note>

#### Prepare Gateway API ingress

For remote Helmfile deployments, set up Gateway API ingress before you configure
the CLI. The CLI calls the configured API, API Keys,
invocation, and gRPC endpoints during token minting, cluster registration,
health checks, and function operations.

Complete [Gateway quickstart](./gateway-routing.md#gateway-quickstart) before you
configure the CLI. That procedure installs the Gateway API CRDs, creates and
labels the required namespaces, installs Envoy Gateway, creates the GatewayClass
and Gateway, waits for the Gateway to be programmed, and exports:

```bash
echo "$HTTP_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE/$HTTP_GATEWAY_NAME"
echo "$GRPC_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE/$GRPC_GATEWAY_NAME"
echo "$GATEWAY_ADDR"
echo "$GRPC_GATEWAY_ADDR"
```

These are the same Gateway setup steps used by the Helmfile and standalone
install paths. Keep the exported values in your shell, then configure the CLI.
The local k3d quickstart uses local route hostnames instead.

For test environments without production DNS, use the Gateway load balancer
address as the stack domain:

```bash
export STACK_DOMAIN="$GATEWAY_ADDR"
```

For production environments, set `STACK_DOMAIN` to the DNS name that your
HTTPRoute hostnames use.

#### Configuring the CLI

Create your configuration file:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .nvcf-cli.yaml.template .nvcf-cli.yaml
```

Complete self-hosted configuration:

```yaml
# ==============================================================================
# API Endpoints - Point to your gateway load balancer
# ==============================================================================

# Main API endpoint (use http:// for non-TLS setups)
base_http_url: "http://<GATEWAY_ADDR>"

# Invocation endpoint (same as base_http_url for self-hosted)
invoke_url: "http://<GATEWAY_ADDR>"

# gRPC endpoint - uses dedicated TCP port (no Host header needed)
base_grpc_url: "<GRPC_GATEWAY_ADDR>:10081"

# API Keys service endpoint
api_keys_service_url: "http://<GATEWAY_ADDR>"

# ==============================================================================
# Host Header Overrides (Required for Hostname-Based Routing)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Because the gateway routes HTTP requests based on the Host header,
# you must specify the correct Host header for each service.
# These values must match the HTTPRoute hostnames rendered from STACK_DOMAIN.
#
# Without these, the gateway returns 404 because it can't match the route.

# Host header for API Keys service
api_keys_host: "api-keys.<STACK_DOMAIN>"

# Host header for NVCF API (function management)
api_host: "api.<STACK_DOMAIN>"

# Host header for Invocation service
invoke_host: "invocation.<STACK_DOMAIN>"

# ==============================================================================
# API Keys Service Configuration
# ==============================================================================

api_keys_service_id: "nvidia-cloud-functions-ncp-service-id-aketm"
api_keys_issuer_service: "nvcf-api"
api_keys_owner_id: "svc@nvcf-api.local"

# ==============================================================================
# Account Configuration
# ==============================================================================

client_id: "nvcf-default"

# ==============================================================================
# Debugging (optional - set to true for verbose output)
# ==============================================================================

debug: false
```

For test environments without production DNS, the URL fields and host fields
can use the Gateway load balancer address:

```yaml
# Gateway load balancer address
base_http_url: "http://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
invoke_url: "http://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
base_grpc_url: "a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:10081"
api_keys_service_url: "http://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"

# Host headers matching HTTPRoute configuration
api_keys_host: "api-keys.a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
api_host: "api.a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
invoke_host: "invocation.a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"

# API Keys service
api_keys_service_id: "nvidia-cloud-functions-ncp-service-id-aketm"
api_keys_issuer_service: "nvcf-api"
api_keys_owner_id: "svc@nvcf-api.local"

client_id: "nvcf-default"
debug: true
```

#### Verifying Your Configuration

After configuring the CLI, verify connectivity:

```bash
# Test token generation (uses api_keys_host)
./nvcf-cli init

# Expected output:
# [INFO] Starting fresh session...
# [INFO] Generating admin token from API Keys service...
# [DEBUG] Using Host header override: api-keys.<your-gateway>
# [SUCCESS] Admin token generated and saved
```

If you see a 404 error, verify:

1. The `api_keys_host` value matches your HTTPRoute hostname
2. The gateway load balancer is accessible
3. The API Keys service is running: `kubectl get pods -n api-keys`

<Note>
Why Host headers are needed: the Envoy Gateway uses hostname-based routing to
direct traffic to different backend services through a single load balancer.
Without the correct `Host` header, the gateway cannot match the request to a
route and returns 404.

</Note>

<Tip>
gRPC does not need Host headers because it uses a dedicated TCP listener on
port 10081. The gateway routes all traffic on that port directly to the gRPC
service without hostname matching.

</Tip>

#### Production Setup: DNS and HTTPS

The Host header configuration above is designed for testing and development. For production deployments, configure proper DNS and TLS to eliminate the need for Host header overrides.

With proper DNS and HTTPS configured:

- DNS records resolve service hostnames directly to your Gateway's load balancer
- TLS certificates secure all traffic
- The CLI uses simple URLs without Host header overrides
- Browsers and other clients can access services directly

```yaml
# Simple URLs using your domain - no Host header overrides needed!
base_http_url: "https://api.nvcf.example.com"
invoke_url: "https://invocation.nvcf.example.com"
base_grpc_url: "grpc.nvcf.example.com:443"
api_keys_service_url: "https://api-keys.nvcf.example.com"

# No host header overrides required - DNS handles routing
# api_keys_host: ""  # Not needed
```

<Note>
For complete instructions on setting up DNS records and TLS certificates, see [production-dns-https](./gateway-routing.md) in the Gateway Routing guide.

</Note>

#### Multi-Environment Setup

Use the `--config` flag to manage multiple environments with separate configuration files:

```bash
# Development
./nvcf-cli --config dev.yaml init
./nvcf-cli --config dev.yaml function create --input-file function.json

# Production
./nvcf-cli --config prod.yaml init
./nvcf-cli --config prod.yaml function list
```

Each configuration maintains separate state files (e.g., `~/.nvcf-cli.dev.state` for `dev.yaml`).

#### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging by adding to your configuration file:

```yaml
debug: true
```

Or use the `--debug` flag or `NVCF_DEBUG=true` environment variable per-command.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize - generate admin token
./nvcf-cli init

# 2. Generate API key for invocations
./nvcf-cli api-key generate

# 3. Create a function, update example file with your image
./nvcf-cli function create --input-file examples/create-function.json

# 4. Deploy the function (uses saved context automatically)
./nvcf-cli function deploy create

# 5. Invoke the function
./nvcf-cli function invoke --request-body '{"message": "hello world"}'

# 6. Clean up
./nvcf-cli function deploy remove
./nvcf-cli function delete
```

<Note>
For immediate testing, you can use `load_tester_supreme` from `nvcf-onprem` (see [self-hosted-artifact-manifest](./manifest.md)), which supports the `{"message": "hello world"}` request body above. For more function samples, see the [nv-cloud-function-helpers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-cloud-function-helpers) repository and [function-creation](./function-creation.md) for function creation documentation.

</Note>

## Authentication

The CLI stores three bearer credential types:

- `NVCF_TOKEN`: Generated by `nvcf-cli init`. The default CLI credential for
  management operations and self-hosted cluster management.
- `NVCF_API_KEY`: Generated by `nvcf-cli api-key generate`. The default CLI
  credential for function invocation, function discovery, and queue status.
- `NVCF_NVCT_API_KEY`: Generated by `nvcf-cli api-key generate`. Used
  automatically for all `task` subcommands.

For NVCF API endpoints, either bearer type can be used when it includes the
required scope. The CLI prefers `NVCF_API_KEY` for read, invoke, and queue
commands. It prefers `NVCF_TOKEN` for management commands when both credentials
are configured. Self-hosted SIS cluster management uses `NVCF_TOKEN`. Task
commands always use `NVCF_NVCT_API_KEY`.

See [Scope reference](./api.md#scope-reference) for the self-hosted scope
matrix used by CLI commands and API endpoints.

### Generate NVCF_TOKEN

```bash
# Generate fresh NVCF_TOKEN (clears existing state)
./nvcf-cli init

# With debug output
./nvcf-cli init --debug

# Example output:
# [INFO] Starting fresh session...
# [INFO] Generating admin token from API Keys service...
# [SUCCESS] Admin token generated and saved
# Token: <admin-token>
# Expires: 2025-11-19 06:08:15
```

### Refresh NVCF_TOKEN

Refresh your token while preserving function context:

```bash
# Refresh NVCF_TOKEN (keeps current function state)
./nvcf-cli refresh

# Example output:
# [SUCCESS] Admin token refreshed
# Function ID: func-abc123  (preserved)
```

### Generate API Keys

`api-key generate` mints both a function key (`NVCF_API_KEY`) and a task key
(`NVCF_NVCT_API_KEY`) in a single command. Use `--for` to generate only one.

```bash
# Generate both keys with defaults (24h expiration)
./nvcf-cli api-key generate

# Generate only the function key
./nvcf-cli api-key generate --for function

# Generate only the task key
./nvcf-cli api-key generate --for task

# Custom expiration and description
./nvcf-cli api-key generate --expires-in 48h --description "Production key"

# Generate with custom scopes (requires --for)
./nvcf-cli api-key generate --for function --scopes invoke_function,list_functions

# Generate and validate
./nvcf-cli api-key generate --validate
```

Default function key scopes:

| Scope | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `invoke_function` | Execute deployed functions |
| `list_functions` | View available functions |
| `list_functions_details` | View detailed function metadata |
| `queue_details` | Monitor function execution queues |

Default task key scopes:

| Scope | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `launch_task` | Submit new tasks |
| `list_tasks` | List tasks |
| `task_details` | Get task status and details |
| `cancel_task` | Cancel a running task |
| `delete_task` | Delete a task |
| `list_events` | List task events |
| `list_results` | Retrieve task results |
| `update_secrets` | Update secrets for a task |

## Command Reference

### Self-hosted Deployment Commands

Use these commands to install and inspect self-hosted NVCF deployments. For the local k3d installation flow, see [Quickstart](./quickstart.md).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `self-hosted check --pre` | Check local tools and Kubernetes access before installation. |
| `self-hosted check --all` | Run all currently available self-hosted checks. Use this with pod, route, and function smoke validation. |
| `self-hosted up --cluster-name <cluster-name> --nca-id <nca-id> --region <region>` | Run the local k3d fresh-install flow. |
| `self-hosted status` | Show a deployment health summary. |
| `self-hosted install --control-plane` | Run the control-plane installation primitive. |
| `self-hosted install --compute-plane --cluster-name <cluster-name>` | Run the compute-plane installation primitive for a registered GPU cluster. |
| `self-hosted uninstall --compute-plane --cluster-name <cluster-name>` | Remove compute-plane components for the GPU cluster. |
| `self-hosted uninstall --control-plane` | Remove control-plane components. |

Bundle source overrides:

- `--control-plane-stack` selects the control-plane stack bundle.
- `--compute-plane-stack` selects the compute-plane stack bundle.
- Both flags accept local paths, git URLs, and `oci://` references.

`self-hosted up` supports only a single local k3d cluster. It requires
`--env local`, a current `k3d-*` kube context, and no split-context flags. For
separate control-plane and GPU clusters, use the explicit control-plane and
compute-plane install primitives with [Self-Managed Clusters](./cluster-management/self-managed.md).

### Cluster Registration

Self-managed GPU clusters must be registered with the control plane before the NVCA
operator can start an agent. Registration records the GPU cluster's OIDC issuer and public
JWKS with the control plane (ICMS) so the agent's projected service account tokens (PSAT)
validate at runtime. The `cluster register` command performs this registration and prints
the Helm values the operator install needs.

<Note>
`init` does double duty: it mints the admin token and discovers the control-plane issuer.
Run `init` before `cluster register`. The one-click `self-hosted up` flow runs both
internally.

</Note>

```bash
# 1. Mint the admin token and discover the control-plane issuer
./nvcf-cli init

# 2. Register the GPU cluster (prints a summary and a Helm values block)
./nvcf-cli cluster register \
  --name <cluster-name> \
  --nca-id <nca-id> \
  --region <region> \
  --icms-url "http://<GATEWAY_ADDR>" \
  --ignore-existing
```

`cluster register` flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--name` | Cluster name (required) |
| `--nca-id` | NCA/tenant ID (required) |
| `--region` | Cluster region (default: `us-west-1`) |
| `--icms-url` | SIS/ICMS endpoint URL the agent uses to reach the control plane |
| `--nats-url` | NATS endpoint URL for the agent (optional) |
| `--kubeconfig` | Path to the target GPU cluster kubeconfig (defaults to the current context) |
| `--oidc-issuer-url` | OIDC issuer URL. Overrides auto-detection and skips SPIRE and Kubernetes discovery |
| `--ignore-existing` | Return existing IDs instead of failing if the cluster is already registered |

Issuer and JWKS discovery: `cluster register` detects the GPU cluster's OIDC issuer and
fetches its public JWKS, then sends them to ICMS. Detection precedence:

1. `--oidc-issuer-url` if provided (manual override).
2. A SPIRE OIDC discovery service in the cluster, if present.
3. The Kubernetes API server OIDC endpoint (default).

The detected source is recorded as `identitySource` in the output: `psat` for the
Kubernetes API server, `spire` for SPIRE, or `custom` for a manual issuer.

Output: the command prints a summary (cluster group ID, cluster ID, OIDC issuer, region)
followed by a `--- Helm values for nvca-operator ---` block. Copy that YAML block into a
`<cluster-name>-register-values.yaml` file and pass it to the operator install. The values
schema:

```yaml
clusterID: <uuid>
clusterGroupID: <uuid>
ncaID: <nca-id>
region: <region>
selfManaged:
  identitySource: psat
  icmsServiceURL: "http://<GATEWAY_ADDR>"
  revalServiceURL: "http://<GATEWAY_ADDR>"
  natsURL: "nats://<GATEWAY_ADDR>:4222"
```

For load-balancer-fronted gateways that route by hostname, add the matching host-header
overrides (`selfManaged.icmsServiceHostHeaderOverride`,
`selfManaged.revalServiceHostHeaderOverride`, `selfManaged.natsHostOverride`) to these
values. See [self-managed-clusters](./cluster-management/self-managed.md) for how the
register values feed the operator install and when host-header overrides are required.

### General Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | Generate admin token and start fresh session |
| `refresh` | Refresh admin token while preserving function context |
| `status` | Display CLI state and configuration (use `--show-tokens` for full token output) |
| `version` | Show CLI version information |
| `completion` | Generate shell autocompletion scripts (supports `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`) |

### API Key Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `api-key generate` | Generate function and task API keys (both by default; use `--for function` or `--for task` for one) |
| `api-key list` | List all API keys |

| `api-key clear` | Clear saved API key from state (supports `--force`) |
| `api-key clear-all` | Delete all API keys for an owner (supports `--force`) |

### Task Commands

Task commands manage NVCT (NVIDIA Cloud Tasks) workloads. They require a task
API key, which `api-key generate` mints automatically alongside the function key.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `task create` | Submit a new task (saves task ID to state) |
| `task list` | List tasks, optionally filtered by status |
| `task get` | Get details for a task by ID |
| `task cancel` | Cancel a running task |

| `task events` | List events for a task |
| `task results` | Retrieve results for a completed task |
| `task update-secrets` | Update secrets for a task |
| `task bulk` | Retrieve details for multiple tasks by ID |

```bash
# Generate both keys (required before task commands)
./nvcf-cli api-key generate

# Submit a container task
./nvcf-cli task create \
  --name my-training-job \
  --gpu H100 \
  --instance-type GPU.H100_1x \
  --image my-registry/training:latest

# Check task details
./nvcf-cli task get

# Stream lifecycle events
./nvcf-cli task events

# Cancel a running task
./nvcf-cli task cancel

# List recent tasks
./nvcf-cli task list
```

### Function Management Commands

  --llm-model "name=dummy-model,uris=/v1/chat/completions|/v1/responses|/v1/embeddings,routingMethod=round_robin,tokenRateLimit=1000-S"
```

All `function create` flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--name` | Function name (required) |
| `--image` | Container image (required) |
| `--inference-url` | Inference endpoint URL (required) |
| `--inference-port` | Inference endpoint port (required) |

| `--health-port` | Health check endpoint port |
| `--health-protocol` | Health protocol (`HTTP` or `gRPC`) |
| `--health-timeout` | Health check timeout (ISO 8601 duration, e.g., `PT30S`) |
| `--health-expected-status` | Expected health check status code (default: 200) |
| `--container-args` | Arguments for container launch |

| `--llm-model` | LLM model config in `name=MODEL,uris=URI\|URI,routingMethod=round_robin\|power_of_two\|groq_multiregion\|pulsar\|random,tokenRateLimit=LIMIT` format (repeatable). Token limits use `<value>-<unit>` with `S`, `M`, `H`, `D`, or `W`, for example `1000-S`. Use JSON input for combined token limits because inline model specs use commas as field separators. |
| `--resources` | Resource artifacts in `name:version:uri` format (repeatable) |
| `--helm-chart` | Helm chart specification |
| `--helm-chart-service` | Helm chart service name |
| `--rate-limit` | Rate limit pattern (e.g., `100-S`, `50-M`, `10-H`, `5-D`) |

Example function JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "my-inference-function",
  "containerImage": "nvcr.io/your-org/your-image:tag",
  "inferenceUrl": "/predict",
  "inferencePort": 8000,
  "health": {
    "protocol": "HTTP",
    "uri": "/health",
    "port": 8000,
    "timeout": "PT30S",
    "expectedStatusCode": 200
  }
}
```

LLM functions use `functionType: "LLM"` and define model routing metadata under `models[].llmConfig`:

```json
{
  "name": "sample-llm-function",
  "containerImage": "nvcr.io/example/openai-compatible:latest",
  "inferenceUrl": "/",
  "inferencePort": 8000,
  "functionType": "LLM",
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "dummy-model",
      "llmConfig": {
        "uris": ["/v1/chat/completions", "/v1/responses", "/v1/embeddings"],
        "routingMethod": "round_robin",
        "tokenRateLimit": "1000-S"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For LLM models, `llmConfig.routingMethod` accepts `round_robin`, `power_of_two`, `groq_multiregion`, `pulsar`, or `random`.
Supported LLM paths are `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, and `/v1/embeddings`.
`llmConfig.tokenRateLimit` accepts one or more comma-separated positive integer token limits in `<value>-<unit>` format. Supported units are `S` (seconds), `M` (minutes), `H` (hours), `D` (days), and `W` (weeks). Use `1000-S` for a single limit, or `1000-S,5000-M,100000-H,500000-D,1000000-W` for a combined limit with distinct units. Use JSON input for combined limits because inline CLI model specs use commas as field separators.

#### Deploy Function

The `function deploy` command group manages deployments with the following subcommands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `function deploy create` | Create a new deployment for a function |
| `function deploy update` | Update an existing deployment |

#### List and Get Functions

```bash
# List all functions
./nvcf-cli function list

# List function IDs only
./nvcf-cli function list-ids

# List versions of a specific function
./nvcf-cli function list-versions <function-id>

# Get details of a specific function version
./nvcf-cli function get \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id>

# Get details as raw JSON
./nvcf-cli function get \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --json
```

#### Update Function

```bash
# Update function tags
./nvcf-cli function update \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --tags "production,v2"

# Update LLM model routing config
./nvcf-cli function update \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --llm-model-update "name=dummy-model,routingMethod=round_robin,tokenRateLimit=1000-S"

# Update from JSON file
./nvcf-cli function update \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --input-file metadata-update.json
```

LLM model updates can also be provided in the input file:

  "modelUpdates": [
    {
      "modelName": "dummy-model",
      "llmConfig": {
        "routingMethod": "round_robin",
        "tokenRateLimit": "1000-S,5000-M,100000-H,500000-D,1000000-W"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Invoke Function

```bash
# Invoke using saved context
./nvcf-cli function invoke --request-body '{"input": "Hello, World!"}'

# gRPC invocation
./nvcf-cli function invoke --grpc --request-body '{"input": "test"}'

# gRPC with custom service and method
./nvcf-cli function invoke --grpc \
  --grpc-service "MyService" \
  --grpc-method "Predict" \
  --request-body '{"input": "test"}'

# Invoke with explicit IDs and timeout
./nvcf-cli function invoke \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --request-body '{"input": "Hello!"}' \
  --timeout 120

# Invoke an LLM function with the chat completions path
./nvcf-cli function invoke \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --model-name dummy-model \
  --inference-url /v1/chat/completions \
  --request-body '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'

# Invoke another OpenAI-compatible LLM path
./nvcf-cli function invoke \
  --function-id <function-id> \
  --version-id <version-id> \
  --model-name dummy-model \
  --inference-url /v1/embeddings \
  --request-body '{"input":"NVCF embeddings check"}'
```

Note: The CLI `function invoke` command detects LLM functions automatically.
For LLM functions, `--model-name` and `--inference-url` are required. The CLI uses the LLM invocation route and sets the OpenAI `model` value to `<function-id>/<model-name>`.

For LLM Gateway endpoint behavior, routing, and session stickiness details, see [LLM Gateway](./llm-gateway.md).

For raw HTTP invocation, HTTP streaming, gRPC metadata, and invocation error
behavior, see [Generic HTTP Function Invocation](./generic-http-function-invocation.md)
and [gRPC Function Invocation](./grpc-function-invocation.md).

Additional `function invoke` flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--grpc` | Use gRPC invocation |
| `--grpc-service` | gRPC service name |
| `--grpc-method` | gRPC method name |
| `--grpc-plaintext` | Use plaintext (insecure) gRPC |
| `--inference-url` | Function path, or OpenAI-compatible path for LLM functions (required for LLM) |
| `--model-name` | OpenAI model name for LLM functions |
| `--timeout` | Request timeout in seconds (default: 60) |
| `--poll-duration` | Invocation hold-open duration in seconds (default: 5) |
| `--input-file` | JSON file with invocation configuration |

#### Queue Management

```bash
# Get queue status for a function
./nvcf-cli function queue status <function-id> <version-id>

# Get position for a specific request
./nvcf-cli function queue position <request-id>
```

#### Delete Function

```bash
# Delete current function from state
./nvcf-cli function delete

# Delete specific function
./nvcf-cli function delete --function-id <func-id> --version-id <ver-id>

# Delete deployment only (keep function definition)
./nvcf-cli function delete --deployment-only --graceful
```

### Registry Credentials Commands

Manage container registry credentials for function images and Helm charts. For comprehensive setup instructions including IAM configuration for AWS ECR, see [third-party-registries-self-hosted](./third-party-registries.md).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `registry-credential add` | Add a new registry credential |
| `registry-credential list` | List all registry credentials |
| `registry-credential get` | Get details of a specific credential |
| `registry-credential update` | Update an existing credential |
| `registry-credential delete` | Delete a registry credential |
| `registry-credential list-recognized` | List all recognized registries |

```bash
# Add registry credentials using base64 secret
./nvcf-cli registry-credential add \
  --hostname "nvcr.io" \
  --secret "<BASE64_ENCODED_USERNAME:PASSWORD>" \
  --artifact-type CONTAINER \
  --description "NGC Container Registry"

# Add registry credentials using username/password
./nvcf-cli registry-credential add \
  --hostname "nvcr.io" \
  --username "<USERNAME>" \
  --password "<PASSWORD>" \
  --artifact-type CONTAINER

# List registry credentials (with optional filters)
./nvcf-cli registry-credential list
./nvcf-cli registry-credential list --artifact-type CONTAINER
./nvcf-cli registry-credential list --provisioned-by USER

# Get details for a specific credential
./nvcf-cli registry-credential get <credential-id>

# Update a credential
./nvcf-cli registry-credential update <credential-id> \
  --username "<NEW_USERNAME>" \
  --password "<NEW_PASSWORD>"

# Delete registry credentials
./nvcf-cli registry-credential delete <credential-id>
./nvcf-cli registry-credential delete <credential-id> --force

# List recognized registries
./nvcf-cli registry-credential list-recognized
```

<Note>
Registry credential changes take up to about 5 minutes to take effect for task creation. `nvcf-cli registry-credential list` and `get` show the new value immediately, but task processing caches account credentials for about 5 minutes (`nvct.nvcf.cache-ttl`), so a task can keep using the previous value until the cache refreshes. After rotating or deleting a credential, allow up to about 5 minutes, or restart the task service to apply it immediately. See [Credential Propagation Delay](./third-party-registries.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

401 Unauthorized on function creation:

```bash
# Regenerate admin token
./nvcf-cli init --debug

# Verify token is being used
./nvcf-cli function create --debug --input-file function.json
# Look for: "Using FUNCTION TOKEN for POST"
```

403 Forbidden on invocation:

```bash
# Regenerate API key
./nvcf-cli api-key generate --validate

# Verify API key is being used
./nvcf-cli function invoke --debug --request-body '{"input": "test"}'
# Look for: "Using API KEY for POST"
```

### Token Expiration

```bash
# Check token status
./nvcf-cli status

# Refresh admin token
./nvcf-cli refresh

# Regenerate API key
./nvcf-cli api-key generate
```

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Enable debug mode to see request details
./nvcf-cli function list --debug

# Verify CLI state and configuration
./nvcf-cli status
```
