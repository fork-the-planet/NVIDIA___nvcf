# Troubleshooting / FAQ

This appendix contains common issues, tips, and clarifications learned from deploying self-hosted NVCF.

## Configuration Issues and Best Practices

### Incorrect Base64 Docker Credentials Format

**Symptom:**

- API migration job fails during installation
- Error appears as a "timeout" in the logs
- Re-running `helmfile sync` or `helmfile apply` appears to succeed but the deployment doesn't work properly
- Functions fail to deploy or pull images

**Root Cause:**

The base64-encoded Docker credential in `secrets.yaml` was incorrectly formatted. A common mistake is encoding **only the NGC API key** instead of the full **basic auth credential** in the format `$oauthtoken:API_KEY`.

**Incorrect (will fail):**

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Only encoding the API key
echo -n 'nvapi-1234567890abcdef' | base64
# Results in: bnZhcGktMTIzNDU2Nzg5MGFiY2RlZg==
```

**Correct:**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Encoding the full credential in basic auth format
echo -n '$oauthtoken:nvapi-1234567890abcdef' | base64
# Results in: JG9hdXRodG9rZW46bnZhcGktMTIzNDU2Nzg5MGFiY2RlZg==
```

**How to Diagnose:**

1. Check the migration job logs specifically:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n nvcf job/nvcf-api-migration -c migration
   ```

2. If you don't see detailed errors, add debug output to migration scripts:

   ```bash
   # Add set -x to the migration script for verbose output
   kubectl edit configmap -n nvcf nvcf-api-migration-scripts
   # Add 'set -x' at the top of the script
   ```

3. Fix your secrets.yaml with correct base64 credential, then follow the [clean-install-procedure](./troubleshooting.md).

**How to Prevent:**

1. **Always use the correct format**: Encode `$oauthtoken:YOUR_API_KEY`, not just the API key

2. **Verify before deploying**: Decode your base64 string to verify it's correct:

   ```bash
   # Verify your encoded credential
   echo 'YOUR_BASE64_STRING' | base64 -d
   # Should output: $oauthtoken:nvapi-1234567890abcdef
   ```

3. **Test NGC authentication**: Before deploying, test that your credential works:

   ```bash
   # Test NGC login with your credential
   echo 'YOUR_BASE64_STRING' | base64 -d | IFS=: read username password
   docker login nvcr.io -u "$username" -p "$password"
   ```

### Registry Credential Change Not Taking Effect

Task creation fails with a `Missing <TYPE> registry credential for hostname` error, or keeps using a previous value, shortly after you add, update, or delete a registry credential, even though `nvcf-cli registry-credential list` and `get` already show the new value.

This is expected propagation delay, not a failure. Task processing caches each account's registry credentials for about 5 minutes (`nvct.nvcf.cache-ttl`, default `PT5M`), and picks up the change once that cached copy refreshes.

- Wait up to about 5 minutes and retry the task.
- To apply the change immediately, restart the task service:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n nvcf rollout restart deployment/nvct-api
   ```

## Identifying Deployment Issues

Use these commands to diagnose deployment problems. For phase-by-phase monitoring during installation, see the Deployment Progression section in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md).

**Find Stuck Deployments:**

```bash
# Pods stuck in pending state
kubectl get pods -A | grep Pending

# Pods with image pull issues
kubectl get pods -A | grep -E "ImagePullBackOff|ErrImagePull"

# Pods in crash loops
kubectl get pods -A | grep CrashLoopBackOff

# Check recent events for errors
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' -A | grep -i error | tail -10
```

**Resource Check:**

```bash
# Check node resources
kubectl top nodes

# Check pod resource usage
kubectl top pods -A | grep -E "nvcf|nats|cassandra|openbao"
```

## Installation & Deployment Issues

### Account Bootstrap Job Failures

**Symptom:**

- `helmfile sync` hangs or fails during the services phase
- Events show `BackoffLimitExceeded` for `nvcf-api-account-bootstrap`
- Bootstrap pod shows `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error` status

**Diagnosis:**

1. Watch events in real-time (run this as soon as helmfile reaches services phase):

   ```bash
   kubectl get events -n nvcf -w
   ```

2. Check the bootstrap job logs:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs job/nvcf-api-account-bootstrap -n nvcf
   ```

3. Check the NVCF API logs for detailed error messages:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n nvcf -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nvcf-api --tail=100
   ```

<Note>
The bootstrap job auto-deletes after ~5 minutes (`ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 300`). Monitor events to catch failures in real-time.

</Note>

<Tip>
**Enable debug logging for the bootstrap job.** The account bootstrap script supports
a `DEBUG` environment variable that enables verbose output. To enable it before
redeploying, patch the bootstrap secret:

```bash
kubectl patch secret nvcf-api-account-bootstrap-secret -n nvcf \
  -p '{"stringData":{"DEBUG":"true"}}'
```

Then follow the "Recovering from Services Failures" steps in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md)
to redeploy. The next bootstrap job run will include detailed debug logs visible via
`kubectl logs job/nvcf-api-account-bootstrap -n nvcf`.

To disable debug logging afterward:

```bash
kubectl patch secret nvcf-api-account-bootstrap-secret -n nvcf \
  -p '{"stringData":{"DEBUG":"false"}}'
```

</Tip>

**Common Causes:**

- **Invalid registry credentials format** - See [Incorrect Base64 Docker Credentials Format]
- **Wrong registry hostname** - Hostname in secrets doesn't match actual registry (e.g., using `nvcr.io` but credentials are for ECR)
- **Missing \`\`\$oauthtoken\`\` prefix** - NGC credentials must be in format `$oauthtoken:API_KEY`

**Solution:**

Fix your `secrets/<environment-name>-secrets.yaml` file, then follow the "Recovering from Services Failures" steps in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md) to preserve your dependencies.

### Pods Stuck in ImagePullBackOff

**Symptoms:** Pods cannot pull container images

**Solutions:**

1. Verify registry credentials:

   ```bash
   # Check secret exists
   kubectl get secret -n nvcf nvcf-image-pull-secret

   # Verify credential is valid
   kubectl get secret -n nvcf nvcf-image-pull-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}' | base64 -d
   ```

2. Verify images exist in your registry:

   ```bash
   # For ECR (replace with your repository name)
   aws ecr describe-images --repository-name <your-ecr-repository-name> --region <your-region>

   # For NGC (if using)
   ngc registry image list nvidia/nvcf/*
   ```

3. Check network connectivity from cluster to registry

### Pods Stuck in Pending

**Symptoms:** Pods remain in Pending state

**Solutions:**

1. Check cluster resources:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe node <node-name>
   ```

2. Verify storage class exists:

   ```bash
   kubectl get storageclass
   ```

3. Check node selectors:

   ```bash
   # View pod events
   kubectl describe pod -n <namespace> <pod-name>

   # Check node labels
   kubectl get nodes --show-labels
   ```

### Helm Release in Failed State After First Install

**Symptom:**

- First `helmfile sync` fails partway through
- Re-running `helmfile sync` or `helmfile apply` appears to succeed but things don't work
- Migrations or initialization jobs weren't executed

**Root Cause:**

When a Helm installation fails, the release remains in a failed state. Subsequent commands run `helm upgrade` instead of `helm install`, which **skips initialization hooks** (migrations, account bootstrap, etc.).

**Solution:**

Fix the underlying issue (credentials, config, etc.), then follow the appropriate recovery procedure in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md):

- **If only services failed** (dependencies are healthy): Use the "Recovering from Services Failures" steps to preserve your dependencies
- **If dependencies are also broken**: Follow the "Uninstalling" section in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md)

### NVCA Operator Fails: nvcfbackends CRD Not Found

**Symptom:**

NVCA Operator installation fails with CRD not found error:

```text
Error: customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "nvcfbackends.nvcf.nvidia.io" not found
```

**Root Cause:**

A race condition occurs where Helm validates CRD references before the CRD is created by the operator's installation hooks. This can happen during first install or when reinstalling after the CRD was deleted.

**Solution:**

Two changes are required in `helmfile.d/03-worker.yaml.gotmpl`:

1. **Add \`\`disableValidation: true\`\`** to the nvca-operator release to disable OpenAPI validation:

```yaml
wait: true
waitForJobs: true
disableValidation: true  # Add this line
labels:
  release-group: workers
```

2. **Remove \`\`--dry-run=server\`\`** from the `helmDefaults.diffArgs` section. This prevents server-side validation during the diff phase, which fails when the CRD doesn't exist:

```yaml
helmDefaults:
  createNamespace: true
  devel: true
  timeout: 900
  wait: true
  waitForJobs: true
  # Note: --dry-run=server removed for worker releases to avoid CRD validation failures
  # when reinstalling nvca-operator after CRD deletion
```

Then run `./force-cleanup-nvcf.sh` followed by `HELMFILE_ENV=<environment> helmfile sync`.

## Accessing OpenBao Secrets (CLI)

NVCF stores most service credentials, signing keys, and internal passwords in
[OpenBao](https://openbao.org/) (a Vault-compatible secrets manager) running in the
`vault-system` namespace. Use the `bao` CLI inside the OpenBao pod to inspect or
manage these secrets.

<Note>
For the full `bao` CLI reference, see the
[OpenBao CLI documentation](https://openbao.org/docs/commands/).
The KV secrets engine commands are documented at
[OpenBao KV commands](https://openbao.org/docs/commands/kv/).

</Note>

### Retrieve the Root Token

The OpenBao root token is stored in a Kubernetes secret created during initialization:

```bash
# Retrieve the root token
export BAO_ROOT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret openbao-server-root-token \
  -n vault-system -o jsonpath='{.data.root_token}' | base64 -d)
```

<Warning>
The root token grants unrestricted access to all secrets in OpenBao. Treat it as a
highly sensitive credential and avoid storing it in shell history or logs.

</Warning>

### List Secrets Engines

To see all mounted secrets engines (each NVCF service has its own path):

```bash
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao secrets list
```

Example output (abbreviated):

```text
Path                             Type                        Description
----                             ----                        -----------

services/sis-api/kv/             kv                          n/a
...
```

### List and Read Secrets

Browse secrets under a specific engine path:

```bash
# List top-level keys under a secrets engine
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao kv list services/nvcf-api/kv

# List keys in a subdirectory (paths ending in / are directories)
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao kv list services/nvcf-api/kv/cassandra

# Read a specific secret
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao kv get services/nvcf-api/kv/cassandra/creds
```

<Tip>
Use `bao kv get -format=json <path>` for machine-readable output, or
`bao kv get -field=<key> <path>` to extract a single field.

</Tip>

### Run Arbitrary `bao` Commands

You can run any `bao` subcommand by exec-ing into the pod with the root token:

```bash
# General pattern
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao <command> [args]

# Examples:
# Check server status
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao status

# List auth methods
kubectl exec -it openbao-server-0 -c openbao -n vault-system -- \
  env BAO_TOKEN=$BAO_ROOT_TOKEN \
  bao auth list
```

## Debugging Techniques

### Enabling Verbose Logging

To get more detailed logs from specific components:

**For Migration Jobs:**

```bash
# Edit the migration script configmap
kubectl edit configmap -n nvcf nvcf-api-migration-scripts

# Add to the top of the script:
set -x  # Enable command tracing
set -e  # Exit on error
```

**Example For API Service:**

```bash
# Set log level via environment variable
kubectl set env -n nvcf deployment/nvcf-api LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Inspecting Failed Pods

```bash
# Get pod status with more details
kubectl get pods -n nvcf -o wide

# Describe a problematic pod
kubectl describe pod -n nvcf <pod-name>

# View logs (current)
kubectl logs -n nvcf <pod-name>

# View logs (previous if pod restarted)
kubectl logs -n nvcf <pod-name> --previous

# Follow logs in real-time
kubectl logs -n nvcf <pod-name> -f

# Logs for all containers in a pod
kubectl logs -n nvcf <pod-name> --all-containers
```

### Checking Events

Kubernetes events often contain valuable debugging information:

```bash
# Get recent events for a namespace
kubectl get events -n nvcf --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Get events for a specific pod
kubectl get events -n nvcf --field-selector involvedObject.name=<pod-name>

# Watch events in real-time
kubectl get events -n nvcf --watch
```

## Recovery Procedures

For detailed recovery steps, see the **Recovering from Partial Deployments** section in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md). This section provides quick reference for common scenarios.

### Choosing a Recovery Strategy

| Failure Scenario | Recovery Strategy | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dependencies failed** (Cassandra, NATS, OpenBao) | Redeploy individual dependency | See `Redeploy Stuck Dependencies`_ below |
| **Services failed** (API, api-keys, etc.) but dependencies OK | Partial recovery (preserve dependencies) | See "Recovering from Services Failures" in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md) |
| **Everything broken** or uncertain state | Full uninstall and reinstall | See "Uninstalling" in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md) |

<Warning>
**Do not attempt to fix failed services by re-running** `helmfile sync` **or** `helmfile apply`. Helm will skip initialization hooks (migrations, account bootstrap) on upgrade, resulting in a deployment that appears successful but doesn't function correctly.

</Warning>

### Redeploy Stuck Dependencies

Dependency services (Cassandra, NATS, OpenBao) can be safely redeployed without affecting other components:

```bash
# Redeploy only Cassandra
HELMFILE_ENV=<environment-name> helmfile --selector name=cassandra apply

# Redeploy all dependencies
HELMFILE_ENV=<environment-name> helmfile --selector release-group=dependencies apply
```

### Reinstalling NVCA Operator Only

If only NVCA needs reinstalling (and NVCF services are working):

```bash
./force-cleanup-nvcf.sh
HELMFILE_ENV=<environment-name> helmfile --selector release-group=workers sync
```

If NVCF services are also broken, follow the "Recovering from Services Failures" steps in [helmfile-installation](./helmfile-installation.md).

### NVCA Force Cleanup Script

If `helmfile destroy` hangs on NVCA cleanup (typically when functions are still deployed in `nvcf-backend`), use the force cleanup script in a new terminal. See [force-cleanup-script](./troubleshooting.md) for the full script and usage instructions.

```bash
./force-cleanup-nvcf.sh --dry-run  # Preview
./force-cleanup-nvcf.sh            # Execute
```

## Database Issues

### Cassandra Pods OOM During Initialization

Symptoms:

- Cassandra pods restart with `OOMKilled` or exit code `137`.
- The `cassandra-migrations` job fails with a consistency-level error such as `Cannot achieve consistency level ALL`.
- The install does not continue to OpenBao or NVCF services.

Diagnosis:

Check Cassandra pod restarts and the previous container state:

```bash
kubectl -n cassandra-system get pods
kubectl -n cassandra-system describe pod cassandra-0 | grep -E "OOMKilled|Exit Code: 137|Last State"
```

Check the migration job log for the first failed keyspace:

```bash
kubectl -n cassandra-system logs job/cassandra-helm-nvcf-cassandra-migrations
```

Root cause:

The Cassandra resource preset is too small for first boot, commit-log replay, or migration startup. The `small` preset is not recommended for cloud installs, and environments that still OOM on `xlarge` should move to `2xlarge`.

Solution:

Increase the preset in your environment file, then resync Cassandra:

```yaml
cassandra:
  resourcesPreset: "2xlarge"
```

```bash
HELMFILE_ENV=<environment-name> helmfile --selector name=cassandra sync
```

If Cassandra was interrupted during migration, also check for dirty migration state before rerunning the full install.

### Cassandra Migrations Fail After Dirty Migration State

Symptoms:

- The `cassandra-migrations` job fails repeatedly after Cassandra restarts during a previous migration attempt.
- Logs show an error similar to `no migration found for version 0`, or another migration error that does not identify the failed keyspace state.
- A row in a `schema_migrations.<keyspace>` table has `dirty=true`.

Diagnosis:

The migration bookkeeping tables live in the `schema_migrations` keyspace, with one table per application keyspace. Check the keyspace named in the migration logs:

```bash
CPASS=$(kubectl -n cassandra-system get secret cassandra \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.cassandra-password}' | base64 -d)

kubectl -n cassandra-system exec cassandra-0 -c cassandra -- \
  /opt/bitnami/cassandra/bin/cqlsh -u cassandra -p "$CPASS" localhost \
  -e "SELECT version, dirty FROM schema_migrations.<keyspace>;"
```

Root cause:

`golang-migrate` marks a keyspace dirty when a migration attempt is interrupted. Cassandra DDL statements may already have committed, but the migration marker remains dirty and blocks the next run.

Solution:

First verify whether the failed migration's DDL was applied or needs manual reconciliation. After the schema matches the dirty version, clear the dirty flag and rerun the migration job:

```bash
kubectl -n cassandra-system exec cassandra-0 -c cassandra -- \
  /opt/bitnami/cassandra/bin/cqlsh -u cassandra -p "$CPASS" localhost \
  -e "UPDATE schema_migrations.<keyspace> SET dirty = false WHERE version = <version>;"

HELMFILE_ENV=<environment-name> helmfile --selector name=cassandra sync
```

If more than one keyspace is dirty, repeat the diagnosis and reconciliation for each affected `schema_migrations.<keyspace>` table.

### Cassandra Migration Stuck Due to Missing ConfigMap

**Symptoms:**

Cassandra pods are running but migration job is stuck.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cassandra-system

...
pod/cassandra-initialize-cluster-qp4ft   0/1     ContainerCreating # Stuck in ContainerCreating state perpetually
```

**Diagnosis:**

Check all Cassandra resources including ConfigMaps:

```bash
kubectl -n cassandra-system get all,secrets,sa,cm
```

Expected output should show **3 ConfigMaps**:

```text
NAME                              DATA   AGE
configmap/cassandra-init-cql      1      5d19h # This one may be missing
configmap/cassandra-init-script   1      100s  # This one may be missing
configmap/kube-root-ca.crt        1      8d
```

If you only see 2 ConfigMaps (missing `cassandra-migrations`), this is a race condition during deployment.

**Root Cause:**

A race condition can occur where the Cassandra migration job starts before all ConfigMaps are created, causing the deployment to hang.

**Solution:**

Force a sync to recreate missing resources:

```bash
# Use helmfile sync instead of apply to force resource recreation
HELMFILE_ENV="<environment>" \
helmfile --environment default --selector name=cassandra sync
```

<Note>
The `sync` command differs from `apply` in that it will recreate resources if needed, which resolves the ConfigMap race condition.

</Note>

**Alternative Solution:**

If the above doesn't work, you can safely redeploy Cassandra (it's a dependency without complex initialization hooks):

```bash
# Delete the stuck migration job first
kubectl delete job -n cassandra-system cassandra-migrations

# Then redeploy Cassandra
HELMFILE_ENV=<environment-name> helmfile --selector name=cassandra apply
```

## Streaming Issues

### WebRTC Streaming Fails After Function Shows Active

**Symptom:**

- A streaming function deploys and shows ACTIVE
- WebRTC clients fail to connect with `NVST_R_GENERIC_ERROR`
- No errors in the function pod logs

**Root Cause:**

UDP traffic on the Kubernetes NodePort range (30000-32767) is blocked by a
cloud-provider network security rule. The function health checks pass over
TCP, so the function appears healthy, but the UDP media path is unreachable.

On Azure (AKS), AKS attaches a second NSG to node NICs in the managed
resource group (`MC_<resource-group>_<cluster>_<region>`). Even if the subnet NSG
allows UDP, the NIC NSG blocks it by default.

**Diagnosis:**

1. Confirm the function is ACTIVE and pods are running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n nvcf-backend -l nvcf-function-name=<function-name>
   ```

2. On Azure, check whether the NIC NSG has a UDP allow rule:

   ```bash
   MC_RG="MC_${RESOURCE_GROUP}_${CLUSTER_NAME}_${LOCATION}"
   for NIC_NSG in $(az network nsg list -g "$MC_RG" --query "[].name" -o tsv); do
     echo "=== $NIC_NSG ==="
     az network nsg rule list -g "$MC_RG" --nsg-name "$NIC_NSG" \
       --query "[?protocol=='Udp']" -o table
   done
   ```

   If any NSG is missing a UDP rule, add it to all of them:

   ```bash
   for NIC_NSG in $(az network nsg list -g "$MC_RG" --query "[].name" -o tsv); do
     az network nsg rule create -g "$MC_RG" --nsg-name "$NIC_NSG" \
       -n allow-udp-nodeports-webrtc --priority 510 \
       --direction Inbound --access Allow --protocol Udp \
       --source-address-prefix Internet --source-port-range "*" \
       --destination-address-prefix "*" --destination-port-range "30000-32767"
   done
   ```

See [Cloud Provider Network Requirements](./streaming-functions.md#cloud-provider-network-requirements)
for the full CSP networking checklist.

### gRPC Session Resumption Fails

#### Symptom

A streaming client receives gRPC NotFound (`grpc-status: 5`) with "no existing
session found" when reconnecting to a function that was previously working. The
function shows active in the control plane. The HTTP status remains 200 for
gRPC responses. The proxy also clears the `nvcf-request-id` cookie so the next
retry starts a fresh session.

#### Root cause

The client is sending a stale `nvcf-reqid` header or `nvcf-request-id` cookie
from a previous session that no longer exists. The gRPC proxy looks up the
request ID, finds no matching worker session, and returns gRPC NotFound.

Common causes of stale request IDs:

- The worker pod was evicted or restarted between requests.
- The session timed out because the connection was idle too long.
- The client is reusing a request ID from a different function or function
  version.

#### Diagnosis

Check whether the client is sending the `nvcf-reqid` header or
`nvcf-request-id` cookie:

```bash
# Look for session-not-found errors in gRPC proxy logs.
kubectl logs -n nvcf -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grpc-proxy --tail=200 \
  | grep -E "no existing session found|worker connection not found"
```

If the logs show "no existing session found for request id", the client is
referencing an expired session.

#### Resolution

Remove the stale request ID from the client and reconnect without it. The proxy
creates a new session and returns a fresh request ID. Update the client to
handle gRPC NotFound by discarding the stored request ID and retrying without
it.

See [Session Resumption](./grpc-function-invocation.md#session-resumption) for
the full request ID lifecycle.

[force-cleanup-nvcf.sh](samples/scripts/force-cleanup-nvcf.sh)

**Usage:**

1. Download or copy the script to your working directory

2. Make executable: `chmod +x force-cleanup-nvcf.sh`

3. Preview what will be deleted:

   ```bash
   ./force-cleanup-nvcf.sh --dry-run
   ```

4. Run the cleanup:

   ```bash
   ./force-cleanup-nvcf.sh
   ```

**What the script does:**

1. Lists and force-deletes all function pods in `nvcf-backend` namespace
2. Deletes all NVCFBackend custom resources
3. Deletes Helm releases in NVCA namespaces
4. Removes finalizers from stuck NVCFBackend resources
5. Deletes the NVCA namespaces (`nvcf-backend`, `nvca-system`, `nvca-operator`)
6. Removes finalizers from namespaces stuck in Terminating state
7. Deletes the NVCFBackend CRD
8. Verifies cleanup completion
