# NVCF Self-Hosted CLI

`nvcf-cli` drives every step of bringing up self-hosted NVIDIA Cloud Functions: cluster registration, control-plane install, compute-plane install, function deploy/invoke, and lifecycle management. Use this skill any time the user wants to operate self-hosted NVCF.

## When to use

- "install self-hosted NVCF" / "bring up an NVCF cluster"
- "register a (compute|GPU) cluster with NVCF"
- "deploy a (container|GPU) function" / "invoke an NVCF function"
- "check NVCF cluster health" / "is my NVCF install OK?"
- "rotate NVCF cluster JWKS" / "the NVCA agent stopped authenticating"
- "tear down NVCF" / "remove the compute plane" / "uninstall NVCF" / "deregister this cluster"
- "preview what `down` would do" / "dry-run uninstall"
- Any reference to `NVCFBackend`, `NVCA`, ICMS, helm releases like `helm-nvcf-*`, or `icms.<domain>` / `api.<domain>` URLs.

## Quick start

For remote one-click installs, prepare Gateway API ingress and CLI endpoint
configuration before running `self-hosted up`. The command applies the control
plane and then immediately calls API, API Keys, invocation, and gRPC endpoints.
If the Gateway is not programmed or the CLI host headers do not match the
HTTPRoutes rendered by the stack environment, post-install health and cluster
registration will fail.

```sh
# Single-cluster (control + compute on the current kubeconfig context):
nvcf-cli self-hosted up --cluster-name=ncp-local

# Split-cluster (control plane on context A, compute plane on context B):
KUBECONFIG=cp.yaml:gpu1.yaml nvcf-cli self-hosted up \
  --cluster-name=ncp-local \
  --control-plane-context=admin@cp \
  --compute-plane-context=admin@gpu1 \
  --icms-url=https://icms.nvcf.example.com

# Add a new compute plane to an existing control plane (no kubectl access to CP needed;
# reaches the control plane via the public ICMS HTTPRoute):
nvcf-cli self-hosted add-compute-plane \
  --cluster-name=ncp-local-2 \
  --compute-plane-context=admin@gpu2 \
  --icms-url=https://icms.nvcf.example.com \
  --token=$ADMIN_JWT

# Tear down (always plan-only first):
nvcf-cli self-hosted down --plan-only --cluster-name=ncp-local --json | jq
nvcf-cli self-hosted down --cluster-name=ncp-local

# Per-plane uninstall (GitOps; mirrors `install`):
nvcf-cli self-hosted uninstall --no-apply --compute-plane --cluster-name=ncp-local | kubectl delete -f -
```

> **`up` vs `add-compute-plane`.** `up` always installs both planes — use it for the *first* install. `add-compute-plane` is the right subcommand any time the control plane is already running and you want to attach an Nth compute cluster.

> **`down` always with `--plan-only` first.** Show the user the `willUninstall.commands[]` array before running for real.

## Core subcommands

| Subcommand | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted check --pre [--local-only \| --control-plane-context=X \| --compute-plane-context=Y]` | Pre-flight: local-host tools + cluster-side prerequisites | Always run first on a new environment |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted install --control-plane \| kubectl apply -f -` | Render + apply the control plane | When you want manual control over apply (GitOps-friendly) |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted install --compute-plane --cluster-name=X \| kubectl apply -f -` | Register cluster + render compute plane | Same — manual apply path |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted up --cluster-name=X` | One-shot first install: pre-flight → control plane → register → compute plane | Standard install path (both planes from scratch) |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted up --plan-only --cluster-name=X` | Dry-run: emit phase-by-phase plan + ETA without changing state | Agent / CI preview before commit |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted add-compute-plane --cluster-name=X --compute-plane-context=Y --icms-url=… --token=$JWT` | Add a new compute plane to an *existing* control plane (no CP install) | Adding the 2nd, 3rd, … GPU cluster after the initial `up` |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted uninstall --control-plane` | Per-plane primitive: `helmfile destroy` on the control plane (refuses if compute planes still registered) | Final teardown after all compute planes are gone, or scripted pipelines |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted uninstall --compute-plane --cluster-name=X` | Per-plane primitive: `helmfile destroy` on a compute plane (no ICMS unregister, no drain) | Just remove the helm releases without the ICMS-side cleanup |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted uninstall --no-apply <plane>` | Render delete YAML via `helm get manifest` | GitOps; `\| kubectl delete -f -` or commit + Argo applies |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted down --cluster-name=X` | Orchestrator: drain → uninstall --compute-plane → cluster delete in ICMS | Standard "remove one GPU cluster" path |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted down --all --confirm` | Orchestrator: tear down every registered compute plane + control plane | Full uninstall |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted down --plan-only --cluster-name=X` | Dry-run preview (phases + helm releases + ICMS rows + ETAs; no helm/helmfile contact) | **ALWAYS run before any actual `down`** |
| `nvcf-cli self-hosted status [--cluster-name=X] [--watch] [--json]` | Snapshot dashboard of cluster identity + component health + recent events | Routine health checks; `--watch` for live |
| `nvcf-cli init` | Mint admin token from API Keys service via the public api gateway | Before any cluster-management operation; idempotent |
| `nvcf-cli cluster register --name=X --nca-id=Y --region=Z [--ignore-existing]` | Register a cluster JWKS+OIDC issuer with ICMS | Standalone register (without compute-plane install) |
| `nvcf-cli cluster rotate --cluster-id=ID` | Rotate cluster JWKS in ICMS | When NVCA's K8s signing key changed and PSAT verification started 401-ing |
| `nvcf-cli cluster delete --cluster-id=ID` | Remove cluster registration from ICMS | **Confirm with user.** Destroys ICMS state for the cluster. |
| `nvcf-cli api-key generate --description="…" --expires-in=1h` | Mint an API key with `invoke_function` scope | Before invoking functions; admin tokens lack this scope by default |
| `nvcf-cli function create --input-file=<json>` | Create function metadata in ICMS | First step of any function deploy |
| `nvcf-cli function deploy create --input-file=<json>` | Schedule a deployment of a created function | Waits for ACTIVE before returning (timeout 900s) |
| `nvcf-cli function invoke --input-file=<json>` | Invoke a deployed function | Requires API key (not admin token) |
| `nvcf-cli function delete --function-id=ID --version-id=VID` | Remove a function and its deployment | **Confirm with user.** |

## Common workflows

For step-by-step playbooks, load the prompt that matches the user's intent:

- **Install from scratch.** [prompts/install-from-scratch.md](prompts/install-from-scratch.md) — k3d cluster → preflight → up → deploy a smoke function.
- **Add a new compute plane.** [prompts/add-compute-plane.md](prompts/add-compute-plane.md) — split-cluster `up` against an existing control plane.
- **Deploy and invoke a function.** [prompts/deploy-and-invoke.md](prompts/deploy-and-invoke.md) — create → deploy → API key → invoke.
- **Diagnose a failed install.** [prompts/diagnose-failed-install.md](prompts/diagnose-failed-install.md) — `status --json` → identify failed component → kubectl describe → remediation.
- **Rotate JWKS.** [prompts/rotate-cluster-jwks.md](prompts/rotate-cluster-jwks.md) — when PSAT auth starts failing.
- **Tear down.** [prompts/teardown.md](prompts/teardown.md) — `down --plan-only` first, then real run. `down --cluster-name=X` for one compute plane (orchestrator: drain + uninstall + cluster delete); `uninstall --control-plane` for the control plane (per-plane primitive); `down --all --confirm` for everything; `uninstall --no-apply <plane> | kubectl delete -f -` for GitOps.

## Safety rules — CRITICAL

**NEVER do these without explicit user confirmation:**
- `nvcf-cli self-hosted down` or `uninstall` in any form — destructive. **ALWAYS run with `--plan-only` (`down`) or `--no-apply` (`uninstall`) first** and show the user what would happen. State which compute plane(s) and whether persistent state would be wiped.
- `nvcf-cli self-hosted down --remove-persistent` (or `uninstall --remove-persistent`) — deletes Cassandra rows, OpenBao seal keys, sr-default user data. **Loss is unrecoverable.** Confirm explicitly that this is what the user wants.
- `nvcf-cli self-hosted uninstall --control-plane --force-with-registered-clusters` — orphans every registered compute plane (PSAT auth breaks immediately). State the consequence before passing this flag.
- `nvcf-cli self-hosted down --all` — nukes everything. Always show the cluster list (`nvcf-cli cluster list`) and get confirmation.
- `nvcf-cli cluster delete` — removes the cluster's ICMS registration; the compute plane immediately stops being able to authenticate.
- `nvcf-cli function delete` — removes a function and any active deployment.
- Any raw `helm uninstall` or `kubectl delete pvc/pv` — affects persistent state. Prefer `nvcf-cli self-hosted down` (orchestrator) or `uninstall` (per-plane) which handle this safely.
- Any `--force` flag (`--force-with-registered-clusters`, `--confirm` in non-interactive contexts).

**ALWAYS do these:**
- Run `nvcf-cli self-hosted status` before assuming a cluster exists / is healthy.
- Show the planned action (cluster name, function name, GPU type, cost if known) before creating.
- Confirm exact resource names before deletion — match against `cluster list` / `function list` output.
- In CI / non-interactive contexts, use `--non-interactive --token=$JWT`. Never propose interactive `nvcf-cli init` when `$CI` is set.

**NEVER paste these into chat / logs / feedback:**
- Admin tokens (full JWT). Show the first 8 chars + `...` if you must reference one.
- API keys (`nvapi-…`).
- Contents of `~/.nvcf-cli.state` or any kubeconfig.
- Any data marked secret in helmfile values.

## Output modes (for agent piping)

`nvcf-cli` subcommands that long-run (`up`, `status`, `check`) accept four output modes:

- **`--json`** — JSONL events on stderr; one event per line; stable schema (`schemaVersion: 2`). **Use this when running under an agent.** Parse line-by-line with `jq -c .` or `json.loads()`.
- **`--plain`** — Plain timestamped lines, RFC3339 UTC, `[NN/8]` phase prefix; grep-friendly. Default in non-TTY.
- **`--accessible`** — Plain output without spinners, with verbose state markers (`[completed]`, `[running]`, `[pending]`, `[failed]`). For screen readers and constrained terminals.
- **(no flag)** — Bubbletea TTY dashboard. Default in TTY ≥100×30. Don't use under an agent (cursor-up sequences are noisy).

Auto-detect picks the right mode for whatever stdout/stderr is. The CLI also honors `NO_COLOR` (any value → forces plain), `TERM=dumb` (forces plain), and `CI=truthy` (forces plain even on a fake TTY). When the terminal is smaller than 100×30, the bubbletea renderer falls back to a compact layout. Explicit `--json` is the right call for agent piping.

## On failure

`nvcf-cli` failures emit structured `phase_failed` events in JSON:

```json
{"event":"phase_failed","phaseNum":4,"phase":"apply-cp",
 "errCategory":"helm_apply","errMessage":"helm install api-keys: timed out",
 "retryClass":"backoff","retryAfterSec":60,
 "remediation":["kubectl describe pod -n cassandra-system cassandra-0",
                "Re-run with --debug for verbose helmfile output"],
 "raw":{"subprocess":"helmfile","exitCode":1,"stderrTail":"…","kubernetesReason":"FailedScheduling"}}
```

The `retryClass` field tells the agent how to handle the failure:

| `retryClass` | Meaning | Agent action |
|---|---|---|
| `immediate` | Transient blip | Retry the same `up` command now |
| `backoff` | Rate limit / pending operation | Wait `retryAfterSec` seconds, then retry |
| `after_remediation` | Operator must intervene | Surface `errMessage` + `remediation`, STOP. Don't auto-retry. |
| `none` | Non-retryable | Same as `after_remediation` — surface and stop |
| `unknown` | Classifier unsure | Treat conservatively: surface and stop |

Never re-run with `--force` (no command takes one). The `raw` block carries the underlying signal (subprocess exit, HTTP status, K8s reason) — quote relevant fields when explaining failures to the user, but don't dump `stderrTail` verbatim into chat without scanning for secrets first.
