# 1. Application inputs

Inputs are important for configuring your run-time application.  When it comes to providing inputs, 
you have a lot of flexibility.  You can define configuration settings or command-line arguments.
Consequently, you can specify their values from any of the source below, in order of precedence:

 1. Config file (supported formats are Json, Toml, Yaml)
 2. Environment variable override config file
 3. Command line parameters override environment variables and config file

We provide a helper function to parse all of these input sources at once and resolve their precedence
order.
```
let (args, settings) = parse_args::<AppCliArgs, AppSettings>().unwrap();
```
where `AppCliArgs` and `AppSettings` are custom structs that you define.  We describe these in more
detail below.

- [Configuration settings](#11-configuration-settings)
- [Environment variables](#12-environment-variables)
- [Command-line arguments](#13-command-line-arguments)

## 1.1. Configuration settings

Configuration settings are created via a struct definition.  In this example:
```
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub(crate) struct AppSettings {
    // Basic server settings
    pub(crate) server: ServerSettings,
    // >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    // Add your own settings below. These are just a few examples.
    // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    pub(crate) custom_1: Option<String>,
    pub(crate) custom_2: Option<Vec<f64>>,
}
```
We import the basic settings for a server app, `ServerSettings`, then add two
custom settings, `custom_1` and `custom_2`.  To specify default values, implement
the default trait for `AppSettings`.

Calling `parse_args` returns the setting values from merging all input sources. 

To export settings into a config file, run the app with the `generate` option:
```
cargo run --bin server -- -g settings.toml
```
To import settings form a config file, run the app with the `config` option:
```
cargo run --bin server -- -c settings.toml
```

## 1.2. Environment variables

Any setting can be overriden by an environment variable with the same path name.  In this
example,
```
SERVER__TONIC__INITIAL_STREAM_WINDOW_SIZE=1234 cargo run --bin server
```
the environment variable `SERVER__TONIC__INITIAL_STREAM_WINDOW_SIZE` is
translated into the setting `server.tonic.initial_stream_window_size`.  If such a
setting exists (it does because it's provided as a default server setting), then
its value is set to `1234`.

## 1.3. Command-line arguments

Command-line args similarly created via a struct definition.  
```
#[derive(Parser, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[command(version, about, long_about = None)]
pub(crate) struct AppCliArgs {
    // >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    // Add your own CLI args below.  These are just a few example types.
    // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    #[arg(long, value_name = "STRING", help = "A string")]
    pub(crate) string_arg: Option<String>,

    #[arg(long, value_name = "BOOL", help = "A boolean flag")]
    pub(crate) flag_arg: Option<bool>,

    #[arg(long, value_name = "FLOAT", help = "A 3D vector", num_args = 3)]
    pub(crate) vector_arg: Option<Vec<f32>>,
}
```
We use the standard `clap` crate to parse the command line.  Thus, you can use the `clap arg`
decorator to interpret the struct attributes as cli args.  See [docs](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/#macros).

```
Any setting can be overriden on the command line by passing it as an override at the end of the command:
```
cargo run --bin server -- --port 50002 -c settings.toml -- tonic_settings.request_timeout=100
```
