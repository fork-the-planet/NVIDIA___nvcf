# NVCF Invocation Service

Run

```shell
cargo run --package nvcf-invocation-service --bin server --release -- -c crates/server/resources/settings-stg-local.yaml  2>&1 | grep '^{.*}$' | jq '.'
```

This connects to the staging NVCF System, so you can invoke any function as normal.

## Using ngrok for External Worker Access

To expose your local service externally using ngrok and configure the self address:

```shell
# Start ngrok tunnel in background and run the service with self address
ngrok http 8080 --log=stdout > /tmp/ngrok.log 2>&1 & sleep 2;
export WORKER_STREAM_PROPERTIES__SELF_ADDRESS=$(curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | jq -r '.tunnels[0].public_url')
echo "Ngrok URL: $WORKER_STREAM_PROPERTIES__SELF_ADDRESS"
cargo run --package nvcf-invocation-service --bin server -- -c crates/server/resources/settings-stg-local.yaml
```

This command will:
1. Start ngrok in the background to forward port 8080
2. Extract the public ngrok URL
3. Run the service with the `WORKER_STREAM_PROPERTIES__SELF_ADDRESS` config set to the ngrok URL

Alternatively, you can run these steps separately:

```shell
# Step 1: Start ngrok
ngrok http 8080

# Step 2: In another terminal, get the ngrok URL and run the service
export WORKER_STREAM_PROPERTIES__SELF_ADDRESS=$(curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | jq -r '.tunnels[0].public_url')
echo "Ngrok URL: $WORKER_STREAM_PROPERTIES__SELF_ADDRESS"
cargo run --package nvcf-invocation-service --bin server -- -c crates/server/resources/settings-stg-local.yaml
```

The ngrok URL will be displayed in the ngrok terminal and can be used to access your service externally.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v2/nvcf/pexec/functions/6c15cde0-d06a-4bbf-a4e1-e587c4ca9a11' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'NVCF-POLL-SECONDS: 10' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ...' \
--data '{
    "message": "What should I see in Paris?"
}'
```

### NVCF as a Transparent Load Balancer

#### General Blocking Form

```plantuml
participant Client as client
participant "NVCF Invocation Service" as is
participant "Envoy" as envoy
participant NATS as nats
participant "Worker (Utils Container)" as worker
participant "Worker (Inference Container)" as inference
participant S3 as s3
participant "NVCF API" as api

worker -> nats: subscribe to queue rq_${region}_${fv-id}

client -> is: http request

group if auth not cached
    is -> api: auth function
    api --> is: allowed function versions, client auth info
end group

is -> is: encode http request headers and up to 32k of body into protobuf
note right
    the entire request including headers can optionally be omitted from
    the protobuf. if omitted, the worker will fetch all request data 
    instead of just the request body with GET attach.
end note
group if more request data is available
    is -> is: add GET attach address and token to protobuf
    group async
        client -> is: stream request data
        is -> is: wait for worker to call GET attach
        is --> envoy: stream request data
        envoy --> worker: stream request data
        note right
            continued from the worker perspective later in the diagram
        end note
    end group
end group

is -> is: add POST attach address and token into protobuf
is -> nats: push request to queue on rq.${region}.${fv-id}.${rq-id}

nats --> worker: encoded http request
worker -> inference: decoded http request
group if more request data is available
    group async
        worker -> envoy: GET attach
        note right
            continuation from the worker perspective
        end note
        envoy -> is: GET attach
        note right
            envoy allows us to direct requests to a particular instance
            of the invocation service
        end note
        is --> worker: stream request data
        worker -> inference: stream request data
    end group
end group

group if transformation mode enabled
    loop
        group if NVCF-POLL-SECONDS reached or progress file detected
            worker -> worker: encode generated 202 http response
        end group
    end loop
end group

inference --> worker: http response header

group if http response is 202
    loop
        worker -> nats: listen for more http requests for this request id on core-nats subject rq_polling.${rq-id} 
        note right
            the current pexec polling api allows us to differentiate
            a polling request from a new request which lets us know when
            to write into the regular request subject vs this polling subject.
            
            for future full passthrough apis, we could differentiate using a
            request id or cookie in the http header.  
        end note
    end loop
end group

group if transformation mode enabled
    worker -> worker: intercept and transform http responses from the inference container
    inference --> worker: read full http response body
    group if large response
        worker -> s3: zip and stream to s3
        worker -> worker: encode 302 http response redirecting to s3
        note left
            if the client calls exec rather than pexec,
            the api is responsible for converting this 302
            response into an exec wrapper body
        end note
    end group
    group if 4xx or 5xx response
        worker -> worker: map error body to problem details format
    end group
    worker -> worker: present transformed http response as the inference response
end group

inference --> worker: inference response
worker -> worker: map response status to metrics event with InvocationStatus
worker -> envoy: POST attach request containing encoded http inference response
envoy -> is: POST attach request containing encoded http inference response
note right
    envoy allows us to direct requests to a particular instance
    of the invocation service
end note
is --> client: http response
worker --> nats: ack work request
```

## Memory Allocator Features

The service supports multiple memory allocator and profiling configurations:

### Default: jemalloc with Profiling Support
The service uses `jemalloc` by default with integrated pprof server for memory profiling:
```shell
cargo run --package nvcf-invocation-service --bin server  # Uses jemalloc + profiling (default)
```

### jemalloc without Profiling
Use jemalloc allocator but disable the pprof HTTP server:
```shell
cargo run --package nvcf-invocation-service --bin server --no-default-features --features jemalloc
```

### Alternative: mimalloc
For high-performance allocation without profiling, you can use `mimalloc`:
```shell
cargo run --package nvcf-invocation-service --bin server --no-default-features --features mimalloc
```

When using both the `jemalloc` and `profiling` features, the service automatically starts a pprof HTTP server on port 6060 with this endpoint:
- `http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs` - Current heap profile (protobuf format)

Example usage:
```shell
# Get heap profile (protobuf format for go tool pprof)
curl -o heap.pb.gz http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs

# Analyze with go tool pprof (includes flamegraph generation)
go tool pprof -http=:8080 heap.pb.gz
```

The profiles can be analyzed using tools like `go tool pprof` or flame graph generators.

## Code coverage

Generate a coverage report in a format VS Code can read:

```cargo-tarpaulin
% cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
% cargo tarpaulin --out LCov --output-dir ./coverage
```

Install the Coverage Gutters extension.  From Vscode:
1. Ctl-Shift-p
1. Type then select, `Coverage gutters: watch`

From the code editor, see that coveraged lines have green sidebars, otherwise red.
To see entire lines highlighted in green and red:
1. Right click the extension and select settings
1. In the settings pane, select `Show line coverage`
1. Open (or re-open) any file
