# Go Lib

This subproject hosts common NVCF components shared by both `egx/cloud` and
`egx/edge`, including:

- API definitions
- Authentication components (OAuth, JWT, token fetching)
- Core HTTP services and event streaming
- Kubernetes client utilities
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Secret management

## Package Structure

The repository is organized into modular packages under `pkg/`:

- `pkg/auth/` - Authentication token fetching
- `pkg/cobraautobind/` - Cobra command binding helpers
- `pkg/core/` - HTTP services, event streaming, Kubernetes clients, and context management
- `pkg/fnds/` - FNDS client and common types
- `pkg/http/` - HTTP utilities, including logger, retry client, and request headers
- `pkg/icms-translate/` - Queue-message translation helpers and CLI support for workload manifests
- `pkg/imagecredential/` - Image credential refresh job and Kubernetes secret helpers
- `pkg/ngc/` - NGC token fetching
- `pkg/nvkit/` - Shared service framework utilities for auth, config, logging, metrics, tracing, servers, and clients
- `pkg/oauth/` - OAuth and JWT handling with JWKS caching
- `pkg/otel/` - OpenTelemetry integration
- `pkg/otelconfig/` - OTel collector config rendering and backend config templates
- `pkg/secret/` - Secret management and file fetching
- `pkg/types/` - Type definitions and configuration
- `pkg/version/` - Version utilities
- `pkg/zapotelspan/` - Helpers for adding OpenTelemetry span fields to zap logs

## Development

Run these commands from `src/libraries/go/lib`:

```bash
# Update vendored dependencies
make vendor-update

# Run linting
make lint

# Run all unit tests
make test

# Run individual unit test
go test ./pkg/core -run TestHTTPServiceRoutes

# Update generated K8s client code
make codegen-update

# Refresh consolidated icms-translate fixtures
make update-testdata

# Verify consolidated icms-translate fixtures are current
make check-testdata
```

Run Bazel commands from the repository root:

```bash
# Build all go-lib Bazel targets
bazel build //src/libraries/go/lib/...

# Run go-lib Bazel tests
bazel test //src/libraries/go/lib/...
```

Bazel build is the current mirror gate. Bazel tests are useful for local cleanup
work, but some targets still have known test cleanup issues.
