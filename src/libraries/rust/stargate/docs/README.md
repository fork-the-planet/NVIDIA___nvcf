# Stargate Docs

> Type: Index. Start here, then read only the docs that match the task.

Use this page as the durable docs entrypoint. The goal is to keep agents and
humans from ingesting every document when only one topic is relevant.

## Start Here By Task

| Task | Read first | Then read only if needed |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Test, coverage, CI, mutation, or behavior-suite work | [Testing](testing/README.md) | [Architecture](architecture/README.md) |
| Benchmark runner, benchmark scenarios, or performance evidence | [Benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md) | [Testing](testing/README.md) |
| Release, change-control, or operator runbooks | [Operations](operations/README.md) | [Architecture](architecture/README.md) |

## Current Versus Historical

Current contracts live in the topic indexes above and in the docs they link as
current. Historical audits and retired contract notes are retained only when
they still explain important rationale.

## Diagrams

PlantUML source lives in [diagrams](diagrams/). Render it with:

```bash
scripts/watch_puml.sh docs/diagrams
```
