# Runtime Stats Interface

> Type: Reference. Source: pylon stats collector, request observer, and mock backend contracts.

Pylon gets request-throughput stats from the inference runtime through:

```text
GET /pylon/v1/stats/stream
Accept: application/x-ndjson
```

Do not put private stats in OpenAI response bodies. Pylon uses the runtime stats
stream when available, and OpenAI chunk metadata only as fallback.

## Flow

```text
client -> stargate -> QUIC tunnel -> pylon -> runtime
runtime -> /pylon/v1/stats/stream -> pylon -> registration -> stargate routing
runtime -> /kv-cache/stats ---------> pylon -> registration -> stargate routing
```

The stream reports request counters. `/kv-cache/stats` is optional machine
state.

## Stream Events

Each non-empty line is JSON with `v: 1` and `type`.

Stats event:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "type": "stats",
  "request_id": "req-123",
  "model": "llama",
  "tokens_processed": 128,
  "tokens_generated": 17,
  "finished": false
}
```

Rules:

- `request_id` and `model` are required.
- Token counters are cumulative unsigned integers.
- At least one counter is required unless `finished` is true.
- Pylon computes deltas and ignores duplicate or regressing counters.
- `finished: true` closes the request; later events for it are ignored.
- Malformed events are counted and dropped. They do not close the stream.

Ping:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"ping"}
```

## Source Modes

```text
--engine-stats-stream=auto|required|off
--engine-stats-stream-path=/pylon/v1/stats/stream
```

- `auto`: use the stream. If it returns `404`, `405`, or `501` before a valid event, use OpenAI fallback.
- `required`: keep retrying the stream and never fall back.
- `off`: skip the stream and use OpenAI fallback.

Transient errors, malformed events, and EOF do not switch `auto` to fallback.

Fallback reads streamed OpenAI usage fields such as `usage.completion_tokens` or
`output_tokens_so_far`. Text peeking is last resort.

## Optional KV Stats

`/kv-cache/stats` may report runtime machine state:

```json
{
  "model": "model-a",
  "kv_cache_capacity_tokens": 1000,
  "kv_cache_used_tokens": 400,
  "kv_cache_free_tokens": 600
}
```

Use it only when the runtime has reliable KV state.

## Aggregation

Pylon publishes:

- sticky completed-request input throughput: `last_mean_input_tps`
- volatile generation throughput: `output_tps` and `max_output_tps`
- request phase counts and queue sizes
- optional KV capacity/used/free tokens
- source and capability labels

Every publication is derived from one per-model aggregate, so throughput,
request lifecycle load, KV state, and labels cannot diverge between publication
paths. Once a valid cumulative-counter output sample exists, it is
authoritative over live request-timing estimates until stale cleanup clears the
counter-derived output window.

If request stats go stale, volatile output TPS is cleared. Sticky input TPS
stays until a later valid sample replaces it.

Shared clusters sum backend-local live load and union labels. Effective input
capacity is:

```text
sum(active_runtime_reports)
```

Before registration, Pylon bootstraps each model's input-TPS distribution from
exactly one source: local calibration or `--initial-input-tps`. The initialized
distribution is immediately ready and later valid runtime samples update it.

Labels:

- capabilities: `request.output.chunk_usage`,
  `machine.kv_cache.http`, `model.throughput.engine_stream`
- sources: `chunk_usage`, `kv_cache_stats`, `engine_stats_stream`

## Metrics

Runtime-stats metrics use the `pylon_engine_stats_*` prefix for stream events,
invalid events, reconnects, connection state, live requests, model states,
stale cleanup, dirty snapshots, and source transitions.

`pylon_engine_stats_model_states` counts models admitted into aggregate
counter or stream-observation state. Lifecycle-only and KV-only model state
does not inflate that gauge.

## Mock Defaults

`mock-dynamo` serves the stats stream, OpenAI-compatible
chat/Responses/embeddings endpoints, and `/kv-cache/stats`. Use
`pylon --engine-stats-stream=off` when a test intentionally exercises OpenAI
fallback.
