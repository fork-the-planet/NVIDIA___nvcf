Feature: Install a single-cluster NVCF stack on a pre-provisioned EKS cluster with Helmfile
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to use the documented Helmfile workflow against a pre-provisioned
  EKS cluster, so that I can install a single-cluster control plane and
  register and install the NVCA operator on the same cluster, without
  going through the CLI install path.

  # The register-cluster Makefile target provided in the
  # nvcf-self-managed-stack runs `nvcf-cli init` internally before
  # the cluster register call, so this feature does not need a
  # separate init step.
  #
  # This feature is values-driven (not profile-driven); see
  # AGENTS.md "CLI vs Helmfile install paths".
  #
  # Required environment variables (user-supplied):
  #   NVCF_CLI                       built CLI path (harness)
  #   NGC_API_KEY                    NGC API key
  #   SAMPLE_NGC_ORG / SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM
  #                                  NGC org/team for nvcr.io image
  #                                  + chart pulls
  #   EKS_CONTEXT                    full kubectl context
  #   EKS_CLUSTER_NAME               Cluster name used in registration
  #   EKS_REGION                     AWS region
  #
  # NOT user-supplied (feature exports it):
  #   EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR               captured from gateway/nvcf-gateway
  #                                  .status.addresses[0].value after
  #                                  the Gateway is Programmed.
  #
  # Cluster prerequisites (feature does NOT install these):
  #   - EBS CSI driver (provisions the gp3 StorageClass)
  #   - fake GPU operator
  #
  # cert-manager is installed by the control-plane helmfile
  # (helmfile.d/01-dependencies.yaml.gotmpl), not the worker layer,
  # so the feature installs it as part of @control-plane.
  #
  # The nvcf-cli config is NOT user-supplied: the @nvca-registration
  # scenario below copies tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-cli-nonlocal.yaml.template
  # into a runtime path under tests/bdd/out/ and patches the URL + Host
  # fields from ${EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR}. This mimics what a user does after
  # a successful helmfile install: discover the gateway address, then
  # author the CLI config with GATEWAY_ADDR-derived URLs and Host
  # headers (per docs/v0.5/helmfile-installation.md).
  #
  # Pre-suite cleanup:
  # tests/bdd/scripts/destroy-nonlocal-stack.sh
  #   --control-plane-context ${EKS_CONTEXT}
  #   --compute-context ${EKS_CONTEXT}

  Background:
    Given environment variable "NVCF_CLI" is set
    And environment variable "NGC_API_KEY" is set
    And environment variable "SAMPLE_NGC_ORG" is set
    And environment variable "SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM" is set
    And environment variable "EKS_CONTEXT" is set
    And environment variable "EKS_CLUSTER_NAME" is set
    And environment variable "EKS_REGION" is set
    # Create NGC dockerconfig registry credentials
    And I copy the file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" to "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/eks-bdd-secrets.yaml"
    And I substitute "REPLACE_WITH_BASE64_DOCKER_CREDENTIAL" in file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/eks-bdd-secrets.yaml" with base64 of "$oauthtoken:${NGC_API_KEY}"
    And I run command "kubectl --context ${EKS_CONTEXT} get nodes -o name"
    And the command exit code should be 0

  @gateway-setup
  Scenario: Install gateway, capture ELB address, and author the EKS env file
    # Captures the user's manual setup steps per
    # docs/v0.5/helmfile-installation.md Step 1. Installs the
    # envoy-gateway controller, applies the nvcf-gateway Gateway,
    # waits for AWS to provision the NLB, captures the assigned
    # hostname into EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR, and patches eks-bdd.yaml with
    # all the EKS-specific values (including global.domain).

    # 1. Install the envoy-gateway controller in envoy-gateway-system.
    When I run command "helm upgrade --install eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version v1.1.3 --kube-context ${EKS_CONTEXT} -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace --wait --timeout 5m"
    Then the command exit code should be 0

    # 2. Apply the Gateway, GatewayClass, and envoy-gateway namespace.
    When I run command "kubectl --context ${EKS_CONTEXT} apply -f tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-gateway.yaml"
    Then the command exit code should be 0

    # 3. Wait for AWS to provision the NLB and the Gateway to flip
    #    to Programmed=True. Typical NLB-create latency is 3-5min;
    #    timeout is set to 10min for AWS throttling.
    When I run command "kubectl --context ${EKS_CONTEXT} wait --for=condition=Programmed gateway/nvcf-gateway -n envoy-gateway --timeout=10m"
    Then the command exit code should be 0

    # 4. Capture the assigned ELB hostname and export it for
    #    downstream scenarios. The export step asserts the prior
    #    command exited 0 and produced non-empty stdout; the env
    #    Ledger snapshots the prior value (typically unset).
    When I run command "kubectl --context ${EKS_CONTEXT} get gateway nvcf-gateway -n envoy-gateway -o jsonpath={.status.addresses[0].value}"
    Then the command exit code should be 0
    When I export command output to environment variable "EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR"

    # 5. Wait for the ELB hostname to be resolvable from the host's
    #    DNS resolver. AWS DNS propagation typically lags ~30-90s
    #    behind NLB programming; without this wait, subsequent
    #    in-pod connections can fail intermittently.
    When I run command "tests/bdd/scripts/wait-for-dns.sh ${EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR} 180"
    Then the command exit code should be 0

    # 6. Copy base.yaml -> eks-bdd.yaml and patch with the EKS
    #    knobs (including global.domain from the just-exported
    #    EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR).
    #
    #    The three global.nvcaOperator.selfManaged.*Override rows set the NVCA
    #    service Host-header overrides (helm-nvca-operator >=1.12.0).
    #    The helmfile selfManaged inline-values block passes them into the
    #    operator chart, which renders them into the agent config. The agent
    #    dials the bare-ELB service URLs (which DNS-resolve) and sends these
    #    hostnames as the HTTP Host header so the gateway HTTPRoutes match.
    #    This replaces the former @nvca-registration URL-rewrite + hostAliases
    #    workaround.
    When I copy the file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/base.yaml" to "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/eks-bdd.yaml"
    And I update yaml file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/eks-bdd.yaml" with keys:
      | global.helm.sources.repository                   | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |

      | openbao.migrations.issuerDiscovery.enabled   | true                                 |
    Then yaml file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/eks-bdd.yaml" key "global.domain" should equal "${EKS_GATEWAY_ADDR}"

  Rule: Helmfile installs the EKS control plane and NVCA on the same pre-provisioned cluster
