Feature: Bring up a local single-cluster NVCF stack with the CLI
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to install a single-cluster control plane and compute plane
  on a local k3d cluster, so that I can validate the install + register
  workflow before using real infrastructure.

  Rule: install --control-plane installs the CP; compute-plane register/install completes the worker layer

    Background:
      Given environment variable "NVCF_CLI" is set
      And environment variable "NGC_API_KEY" is set
      # SAMPLE_NGC_ORG / SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM are consumed by
      # `make build-and-deploy-cluster` (the credential provider
      # validation step) when the `a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is
      # running` step runs the build target. Without them, that target
      # fails at CREDENTIAL PROVIDER VALIDATION and skips the gateway
      # API setup.
      And environment variable "SAMPLE_NGC_ORG" is set
      And environment variable "SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM" is set
      # self-hosted install --env local reads operator-authored local
      # secrets files from both split stacks:
      # deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-secrets.yaml (control
      # plane). Only secrets.yaml.template is tracked in each
      # stack. Author both files from the canonical templates before
      # running install/register. Ledger snapshots whatever
      # local-secrets.yaml state existed before the first write (its
      # prior contents or absence) and restores or removes it at suite
      # teardown, so the working tree stays clean.
      And I copy the file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" to "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-secrets.yaml"
      And I substitute "REPLACE_WITH_BASE64_DOCKER_CREDENTIAL" in file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-secrets.yaml" with base64 of "$oauthtoken:${NGC_API_KEY}"
      # Conflict precheck: ncp-local-cp's k3d serverlb claims
      # 0.0.0.0:8080/8443/4222, the same host ports single-cluster
      # ncp-local needs. Fail loudly here so the operator runs
      # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster`
      # before retrying this feature, rather than discovering the
      # port collision deep inside the build-and-deploy-cluster
      # make target. `k3d cluster get` exits 1 when the named
      # cluster is absent (k3d v5).
      And I run command "k3d cluster get ncp-local-cp"
      And the command exit code should be 1
      And a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is running
      # nvcf-cli self-hosted install renders helmfile manifests that
      # reference imagePullSecrets: [{name: nvcr-pull-secret}]. Create
      # the secret in each NVCF namespace before install so pods can
      # pull nvcr.io images. The step is idempotent (kubectl apply).
      # Real users were running this loop manually before reaching the
      # install command.
      And the "nvcr-pull-secret" image pull secret exists in namespaces:
        | cassandra-system |
        | nats-system      |
        | nvcf             |
        | api-keys         |
        | ess              |
        | sis              |
        | vault-system     |
        | nvca-operator    |
        | cert-manager     |
